A WELL KNOWN SCIENTIST SOME SAY IT WAS BERTRAND RUSSELL ONCE GAVE A PUBLIC LECTURE ON ASTRONOMY HE DESCRIBED HOW THE EARTH ORBITS AROUND THE SUN AND HOW THE SUN IN TURN ORBITS AROUND THE CENTER OF A VAST COLLECTION OF STARS CALLED OUR GALAXY AT THE END OF THE LECTURE A LITTLE OLD LADY AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM GOT UP AND SAID WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD US IS RUBBISH THE WORLD IS REALLY A FLAT PLATE SUPPORTED ON THE BACK OF A GIANT TORTOISE THE SCIENTIST GAVE A SUPERIOR SMILE BEFORE REPLYING WHAT IS THE TORTOISE STANDING ON YOURE VERY CLEVER YOUNG MAN VERY CLEVER SAID THE OLD LADY BUT ITS TURTLES ALL THE WAY DOWN MOST PEOPLE WOULD FIND THE PICTURE OF OUR UNIVERSE AS AN INFINITE TOWER OF TORTOISES RATHER RIDICULOUS BUT WHY DO WE THINK WE KNOW BETTER WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE UNIVERSE AND HOW DO WE KNOW IT WHERE DID THE UNIVERSE COME FROM AND WHERE IS IT GOING DID THE UNIVERSE HAVE A BEGINNING AND IF SO WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THEN WHAT IS THE NATURE OF TIME WILL IT EVER COME TO AN END CAN WE GO BACK IN TIME RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS IN PHYSICS MADE POSSIBLE IN PART BY FANTASTIC NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUGGEST ANSWERS TO SOME OF THESE LONGSTANDING QUESTIONS SOMEDAY THESE ANSWERS MAY SEEM AS OBVIOUS TO US AS THE EARTH ORBITING THE SUN OR PERHAPS AS RIDICULOUS AS A TOWER OF TORTOISES ONLY TIME WHATEVER THAT MAY BE WILL TELL AS LONG AGO AS BC THE GREEK PHILOSOPHER ARISTOTLE IN HIS BOOK ON THE HEAVENS WAS ABLE TO PUT FORWARD TWO GOOD ARGUMENTS FOR BELIEVING THAT THE EARTH WAS A ROUND SPHERE RATHER THAN A HAT PLATE FIRST HE REALIZED THAT ECLIPSES OF THE MOON WERE CAUSED BY THE EARTH COMING BETWEEN THE SUN AND THE MOON THE EARTHS SHADOW ON THE MOON WAS ALWAYS ROUND WHICH WOULD BE TRUE ONLY IF THE EARTH WAS SPHERICAL IF THE EARTH HAD BEEN A FLAT DISK THE SHADOW WOULD HAVE BEEN ELONGATED AND ELLIPTICAL UNLESS THE ECLIPSE ALWAYS OCCURRED AT A TIME WHEN THE SUN WAS DIRECTLY UNDER THE CENTER OF THE DISK SECOND THE GREEKS KNEW FROM THEIR TRAVELS THAT THE NORTH STAR APPEARED LOWER IN THE SKY WHEN VIEWED IN THE SOUTH THAN IT DID IN MORE NORTHERLY REGIONS SINCE THE NORTH STAR LIES OVER THE NORTH POLE IT APPEARS TO BE DIRECTLY ABOVE AN OBSERVER AT THE NORTH POLE BUT TO SOMEONE LOOKING FROM THE EQUATOR IT APPEARS TO LIE JUST AT THE HORIZON FROM THE DIFFERENCE IN THE APPARENT POSITION OF THE NORTH STAR IN EGYPT AND GREECE ARISTOTLE EVEN QUOTED AN ESTIMATE THAT THE DISTANCE AROUND THE EARTH WAS STADIA IT IS NOT KNOWN EXACTLY WHAT LENGTH A STADIUM WAS BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN ABOUT  YARDS WHICH WOULD MAKE ARISTOTLES ESTIMATE ABOUT TWICE THE CURRENTLY ACCEPTED FIGURE THE GREEKS EVEN HAD A THIRD ARGUMENT THAT THE EARTH MUST BE ROUND FOR WHY ELSE DOES ONE FIRST SEE THE SAILS OF A SHIP COMING OVER THE HORIZON AND ONLY LATER SEE THE HULL ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THE EARTH WAS STATIONARY AND THAT THE SUN THE MOON THE PLANETS AND THE STARS MOVED IN CIRCULAR ORBITS ABOUT THE EARTH HE BELIEVED THIS BECAUSE HE FELT FOR MYSTICAL REASONS THAT THE EARTH WAS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE AND THAT CIRCULAR MOTION WAS THE MOST PERFECT THIS IDEA WAS ELABORATED BY PTOLEMY IN THE SECOND CENTURY AD INTO A COMPLETE COSMOLOGICAL MODEL THE EARTH STOOD AT THE CENTER SURROUNDED BY EIGHT SPHERES THAT CARRIED THE MOON THE SUN THE STARS AND THE FIVE PLANETS KNOWN AT THE TIME MERCURY VENUS MARS JUPITER AND SATURN THE PLANETS THEMSELVES MOVED ON SMALLER CIRCLES ATTACHED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE SPHERES IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR RATHER COMPLICATED OBSERVED PATHS IN THE SKY THE OUTERMOST SPHERE CARRIED THE SO CALLED FIXED STARS WHICH ALWAYS STAY IN THE SAME POSITIONS RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER BUT WHICH ROTATE TOGETHER ACROSS THE SKY WHAT LAY BEYOND THE LAST SPHERE WAS NEVER MADE VERY CLEAR BUT IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT PART OF MANKINDS OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE PTOLEMYS MODEL PROVIDED A REASONABLY ACCURATE SYSTEM FOR PREDICTING THE POSITIONS OF HEAVENLY BODIES IN THE SKY BUT IN ORDER TO PREDICT THESE POSITIONS CORRECTLY PTOLEMY HAD TO MAKE AN ASSUMPTION THAT THE MOON FOLLOWED A PATH THAT SOMETIMES BROUGHT IT TWICE AS CLOSE TO THE EARTH AS AT OTHER TIMES AND THAT MEANT THAT THE MOON OUGHT SOMETIMES TO APPEAR TWICE AS BIG AS AT OTHER TIMES PTOLEMY RECOGNIZED THIS FLAW BUT NEVERTHELESS HIS MODEL WAS GENERALLY ALTHOUGH NOT UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED IT WAS ADOPTED BY THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AS THE PICTURE OF THE UNIVERSE THAT WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SCRIPTURE FOR IT HAD THE GREAT ADVANTAGE THAT IT LEFT LOTS OF ROOM OUTSIDE THE SPHERE OF FIXED STARS FOR HEAVEN AND HELL A SIMPLER MODEL HOWEVER WAS PROPOSED IN BY A POLISH PRIEST NICHOLAS COPERNICUS AT FIRST PERHAPS FOR FEAR OF BEING BRANDED A HERETIC BY HIS CHURCH COPERNICUS CIRCULATED HIS MODEL ANONYMOUSLY HIS IDEA WAS THAT THE SUN WAS STATIONARY AT THE CENTER AND THAT THE EARTH AND THE PLANETS MOVED IN CIRCULAR ORBITS AROUND THE SUN NEARLY A CENTURY PASSED BEFORE THIS IDEA WAS TAKEN SERIOUSLY THEN TWO ASTRONOMERS THE GERMAN JOHANNES KEPLER AND THE ITALIAN GALILEO GALILEI STARTED PUBLICLY TO SUPPORT THE COPERNICAN THEORY DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ORBITS IT PREDICTED DID NOT QUITE MATCH THE ONES OBSERVED THE DEATH BLOW TO THE ARISTOTELIANPTOLEMAIC THEORY CAME IN IN THAT YEAR GALILEO STARTED OBSERVING THE NIGHT SKY WITH A TELESCOPE WHICH HAD JUST BEEN INVENTED WHEN HE LOOKED AT THE PLANET JUPITER GALILEO FOUND THAT IT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY SEVERAL SMALL SATELLITES OR MOONS THAT ORBITED AROUND IT THIS IMPLIED THAT EVERYTHING DID NOT HAVE TO ORBIT DIRECTLY AROUND THE EARTH AS ARISTOTLE AND PTOLEMY HAD THOUGHT IT WAS OF COURSE STILL POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT THE EARTH WAS STATIONARY AT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE AND THAT THE MOONS OF JUPITER MOVED ON EXTREMELY COMPLICATED PATHS AROUND THE EARTH GIVING THE APPEARANCE THAT THEY ORBITED JUPITER HOWEVER COPERNICUSS THEORY WAS MUCH SIMPLER AT THE SAME TIME JOHANNES KEPLER HAD MODIFIED COPERNICUSS THEORY SUGGESTING THAT THE PLANETS MOVED NOT IN CIRCLES BUT IN ELLIPSES AN ELLIPSE IS AN ELONGATED CIRCLE THE PREDICTIONS NOW FINALLY MATCHED THE OBSERVATIONS AS FAR AS KEPLER WAS CONCERNED ELLIPTICAL ORBITS WERE MERELY AN AD HOC HYPOTHESIS AND A RATHER REPUGNANT ONE AT THAT BECAUSE ELLIPSES WERE CLEARLY LESS PERFECT THAN CIRCLES HAVING DISCOVERED ALMOST BY ACCIDENT THAT ELLIPTICAL ORBITS FIT THE OBSERVATIONS WELL HE COULD NOT RECONCILE THEM WITH HIS IDEA THAT THE PLANETS WERE MADE TO ORBIT THE SUN BY MAGNETIC FORCES AN EXPLANATION WAS PROVIDED ONLY MUCH LATER IN WHEN SIR ISAAC NEWTON PUBLISHED HIS PHILOSOPHIAE NATURALIS PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT SINGLE WORK EVER PUBLISHED IN THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES IN IT NEWTON NOT ONLY PUT FORWARD A THEORY OF HOW BODIES MOVE IN SPACE AND TIME BUT HE ALSO DEVELOPED THE COMPLICATED MATHEMATICS NEEDED TO ANALYZE THOSE MOTIONS IN ADDITION NEWTON POSTULATED A LAW OF UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION ACCORDING TO WHICH EACH BODY IN THE UNIVERSE WAS ATTRACTED TOWARD EVERY OTHER BODY BY A FORCE THAT WAS STRONGER THE MORE MASSIVE THE BODIES AND THE CLOSER THEY WERE TO EACH OTHER IT WAS THIS SAME FORCE THAT CAUSED OBJECTS TO FALL TO THE GROUND THE STORY THAT NEWTON WAS INSPIRED BY AN APPLE HITTING HIS HEAD IS ALMOST CERTAINLY APOCRYPHAL ALL NEWTON HIMSELF EVER SAID WAS THAT THE IDEA OF GRAVITY CAME TO HIM AS HE SAT IN A CONTEMPLATIVE MOOD AND WAS OCCASIONED BY THE FALL OF AN APPLE NEWTON WENT ON TO SHOW THAT ACCORDING TO HIS LAW GRAVITY CAUSES THE MOON TO MOVE IN AN ELLIPTICAL ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH AND CAUSES THE EARTH AND THE PLANETS TO FOLLOW ELLIPTICAL PATHS AROUND THE SUN THE COPERNICAN MODEL GOT RID OF PTOLEMYS CELESTIAL SPHERES AND WITH THEM THE IDEA THAT THE UNIVERSE HAD A NATURAL BOUNDARY SINCE FIXED STARS DID NOT APPEAR TO CHANGE THEIR POSITIONS APART FROM A ROTATION ACROSS THE SKY CAUSED BY THE EARTH SPINNING ON ITS AXIS IT BECAME NATURAL TO SUPPOSE THAT THE FIXED STARS WERE OBJECTS LIKE OUR SUN BUT VERY MUCH FARTHER AWAY NEWTON REALIZED THAT ACCORDING TO HIS THEORY OF GRAVITY THE STARS SHOULD ATTRACT EACH OTHER SO IT SEEMED THEY COULD NOT REMAIN ESSENTIALLY MOTIONLESS WOULD THEY NOT ALL FALL TOGETHER AT SOME POINT IN A LETTER IN TO RICHARD BENTLEY ANOTHER LEADING THINKER OF HIS DAY NEWTON ARGUED THAT THIS WOULD INDEED HAPPEN IF THERE WERE ONLY A FINITE NUMBER OF STARS DISTRIBUTED OVER A FINITE REGION OF SPACE BUT HE REASONED THAT IF ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WERE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF STARS DISTRIBUTED MORE OR LESS UNIFORMLY OVER INFINITE SPACE THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY CENTRAL POINT FOR THEM TO FALL TO THIS ARGUMENT IS AN INSTANCE OF THE PITFALLS THAT YOU CAN ENCOUNTER IN TALKING ABOUT INFINITY IN AN INFINITE UNIVERSE EVERY POINT CAN BE REGARDED AS THE CENTER BECAUSE EVERY POINT HAS AN INFINITE NUMBER OF STARS ON EACH SIDE OF IT THE CORRECT APPROACH IT WAS REALIZED ONLY MUCH LATER IS TO CONSIDER THE FINITE SITUATION IN WHICH THE STARS ALL FALL IN ON EACH OTHER AND THEN TO ASK HOW THINGS CHANGE IF ONE ADDS MORE STARS ROUGHLY UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE THIS REGION ACCORDING TO NEWTONS LAW THE EXTRA STARS WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL TO THE ORIGINAL ONES ON AVERAGE SO THE STARS WOULD FALL IN JUST AS FAST WE CAN ADD AS MANY STARS AS WE LIKE BUT THEY WILL STILL ALWAYS COLLAPSE IN ON THEMSELVES WE NOW KNOW IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE AN INFINITE STATIC MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE IN WHICH GRAVITY IS ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE IT IS AN INTERESTING REFLECTION ON THE GENERAL CLIMATE OF THOUGHT BEFORE THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THAT NO ONE HAD SUGGESTED THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS EXPANDING OR CONTRACTING IT WAS GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT EITHER THE UNIVERSE HAD EXISTED FOREVER IN AN UNCHANGING STATE OR THAT IT HAD BEEN CREATED AT A FINITE TIME IN THE PAST MORE OR LESS AS WE OBSERVE IT TODAY IN PART THIS MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO PEOPLES TENDENCY TO BELIEVE IN ETERNAL TRUTHS AS WELL AS THE COMFORT THEY FOUND IN THE THOUGHT THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY GROW OLD AND DIE THE UNIVERSE IS ETERNAL AND UNCHANGING EVEN THOSE WHO REALIZED THAT NEWTONS THEORY OF GRAVITY SHOWED THAT THE UNIVERSE COULD NOT BE STATIC DID NOT THINK TO SUGGEST THAT IT MIGHT BE EXPANDING INSTEAD THEY ATTEMPTED TO MODIFY THE THEORY BY MAKING THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE REPULSIVE AT VERY LARGE DISTANCES THIS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THEIR PREDICTIONS OF THE MOTIONS OF THE PLANETS BUT IT ALLOWED AN INFINITE DISTRIBUTION OF STARS TO REMAIN IN EQUILIBRIUM WITH THE ATTRACTIVE FORCES BETWEEN NEARBY STARS BALANCED BY THE REPULSIVE FORCES FROM THOSE THAT WERE FARTHER AWAY HOWEVER WE NOW BELIEVE SUCH AN EQUILIBRIUM WOULD BE UNSTABLE IF THE STARS IN SOME REGION GOT ONLY SLIGHTLY NEARER EACH OTHER THE ATTRACTIVE FORCES BETWEEN THEM WOULD BECOME STRONGER AND DOMINATE OVER THE REPULSIVE FORCES SO THAT THE STARS WOULD CONTINUE TO FALL TOWARD EACH OTHER ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE STARS GOT A BIT FARTHER AWAY FROM EACH OTHER THE REPULSIVE FORCES WOULD DOMINATE AND DRIVE THEM FARTHER APART ANOTHER OBJECTION TO AN INFINITE STATIC UNIVERSE IS NORMALLY ASCRIBED TO THE GERMAN PHILOSOPHER HEINRICH OLBERS WHO WROTE ABOUT THIS THEORY IN IN FACT VARIOUS CONTEMPORARIES OF NEWTON HAD RAISED THE PROBLEM AND THE OLBERS ARTICLE WAS NOT EVEN THE FIRST TO CONTAIN PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT IT WAS HOWEVER THE FIRST TO BE WIDELY NOTED THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT IN AN INFINITE STATIC UNIVERSE NEARLY EVERY LINE OF SIGHT WOULD END ON THE SURFACE OF A STAR THUS ONE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE WHOLE SKY WOULD BE AS BRIGHT AS THE SUN EVEN AT NIGHT OLBERS COUNTERARGUMENT WAS THAT THE LIGHT FROM DISTANT STARS WOULD BE DIMMED BY ABSORPTION BY INTERVENING MATTER HOWEVER IF THAT HAPPENED THE INTERVENING MATTER WOULD EVENTUALLY HEAT UP UNTIL IT GLOWED AS BRIGHTLY AS THE STARS THE ONLY WAY OF AVOIDING THE CONCLUSION THAT THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT SKY SHOULD BE AS BRIGHT AS THE SURFACE OF THE SUN WOULD BE TO ASSUME THAT THE STARS HAD NOT BEEN SHINING FOREVER BUT HAD TURNED ON AT SOME FINITE TIME IN THE PAST IN THAT CASE THE ABSORBING MATTER MIGHT NOT HAVE HEATED UP YET OR THE LIGHT FROM DISTANT STARS MIGHT NOT YET HAVE REACHED US AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE STARS TO HAVE TURNED ON IN THE FIRST PLACE THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE HAD OF COURSE BEEN DISCUSSED LONG BEFORE THIS ACCORDING TO A NUMBER OF EARLY COSMOLOGIES AND THE JEWISH CHRISTIAN MUSLIM TRADITION THE UNIVERSE STARTED AT A FINITE AND NOT VERY DISTANT TIME IN THE PAST ONE ARGUMENT FOR SUCH A BEGINNING WAS THE FEELING THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE FIRST CAUSE TO EXPLAIN THE EXISTENCE OF THE UNIVERSE WITHIN THE UNIVERSE YOU ALWAYS EXPLAINED ONE EVENT AS BEING CAUSED BY SOME EARLIER EVENT BUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE UNIVERSE ITSELF COULD BE EXPLAINED IN THIS WAY ONLY IF IT HAD SOME BEGINNING ANOTHER ARGUMENT WAS PUT FORWARD BY ST AUGUSTINE IN HIS BOOK THE CITY OF GOD HE POINTED OUT THAT CIVILIZATION IS PROGRESSING AND WE REMEMBER WHO PERFORMED THIS DEED OR DEVELOPED THAT TECHNIQUE THUS MAN AND SO ALSO PERHAPS THE UNIVERSE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AROUND ALL THAT LONG ST AUGUSTINE ACCEPTED A DATE OF ABOUT BC FOR THE CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE ACCORDING TO THE BOOK OF GENESIS IT IS INTERESTING THAT THIS IS NOT SO FAR FROM THE END OF THE LAST ICE AGE ABOUT BC WHICH IS WHEN ARCHAEOLOGISTS TELL US THAT CIVILIZATION REALLY BEGAN ARISTOTLE AND MOST OF THE OTHER GREEK PHILOSOPHERS ON THE OTHER HAND DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF A CREATION BECAUSE IT SMACKED TOO MUCH OF DIVINE INTERVENTION THEY BELIEVED THEREFORE THAT THE HUMAN RACE AND THE WORLD AROUND IT HAD EXISTED AND WOULD EXIST FOREVER THE ANCIENTS HAD ALREADY CONSIDERED THE ARGUMENT ABOUT PROGRESS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND ANSWERED IT BY SAYING THAT THERE HAD BEEN PERIODIC FLOODS OR OTHER DISASTERS THAT REPEATEDLY SET THE HUMAN RACE RIGHT BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF CIVILIZATION THE QUESTIONS OF WHETHER THE UNIVERSE HAD A BEGINNING IN TIME AND WHETHER IT IS LIMITED IN SPACE WERE LATER EXTENSIVELY EXAMINED BY THE PHILOSOPHER IMMANUEL KANT IN HIS MONUMENTAL AND VERY OBSCURE WORK CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON PUBLISHED IN HE CALLED THESE QUESTIONS ANTINOMIES THAT IS CONTRADICTIONS OF PURE REASON BECAUSE HE FELT THAT THERE WERE EQUALLY COMPELLING ARGUMENTS FOR BELIEVING THE THESIS THAT THE UNIVERSE HAD A BEGINNING AND THE ANTITHESIS THAT IT HAD EXISTED FOREVER HIS ARGUMENT FOR THE THESIS WAS THAT IF THE UNIVERSE DID NOT HAVE A BEGINNING THERE WOULD BE AN INFINITE PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE ANY EVENT WHICH HE CONSIDERED ABSURD THE ARGUMENT FOR THE ANTITHESIS WAS THAT IF THE UNIVERSE HAD A BEGINNING THERE WOULD BE AN INFINITE PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE IT SO WHY SHOULD THE UNIVERSE BEGIN AT ANY ONE PARTICULAR TIME IN FACT HIS CASES FOR BOTH THE THESIS AND THE ANTITHESIS ARE REALLY THE SAME ARGUMENT THEY ARE BOTH BASED ON HIS UNSPOKEN ASSUMPTION THAT TIME CONTINUES BACK FOREVER WHETHER OR NOT THE UNIVERSE HAD EXISTED FOREVER AS WE SHALL SEE THE CONCEPT OF TIME HAS NO MEANING BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE THIS WAS FIRST POINTED OUT BY ST AUGUSTINE WHEN ASKED WHAT DID GOD DO BEFORE HE CREATED THE UNIVERSE AUGUSTINE DIDNT REPLY HE WAS PREPARING HELL FOR PEOPLE WHO ASKED SUCH QUESTIONS INSTEAD HE SAID THAT TIME WAS A PROPERTY OF THE UNIVERSE THAT GOD CREATED AND THAT TIME DID NOT EXIST BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE WHEN MOST PEOPLE BELIEVED IN AN ESSENTIALLY STATIC AND UNCHANGING UNIVERSE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT IT HAD A BEGINNING WAS REALLY ONE OF METAPHYSICS OR THEOLOGY ONE COULD ACCOUNT FOR WHAT WAS OBSERVED EQUALLY WELL ON THE THEORY THAT THE UNIVERSE HAD EXISTED FOREVER OR ON THE THEORY THAT IT WAS SET IN MOTION AT SOME FINITE TIME IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO LOOK AS THOUGH IT HAD EXISTED FOREVER BUT IN EDWIN HUBBLE MADE THE LANDMARK OBSERVATION THAT WHEREVER YOU LOOK DISTANT GALAXIES ARE MOVING RAPIDLY AWAY FROM US IN OTHER WORDS THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING THIS MEANS THAT AT EARLIER TIMES OBJECTS WOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSER TOGETHER IN FACT IT SEEMED THAT THERE WAS A TIME ABOUT TEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND MILLION YEARS AGO WHEN THEY WERE ALL AT EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE AND WHEN THEREFORE THE DENSITY OF THE UNIVERSE WAS INFINITE THIS DISCOVERY FINALLY BROUGHT THE QUESTION OF THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE INTO THE REALM OF SCIENCE HUBBLES OBSERVATIONS SUGGESTED THAT THERE WAS A TIME CALLED THE BIG BANG WHEN THE UNIVERSE WAS INFINITESIMALLY SMALL AND INFINITELY DENSE UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS ALL THE LAWS OF SCIENCE AND THEREFORE ALL ABILITY TO PREDICT THE FUTURE WOULD BREAK DOWN IF THERE WERE EVENTS EARLIER THAN THIS TIME THEN THEY COULD NOT AFFECT WHAT HAPPENS AT THE PRESENT TIME THEIR EXISTENCE CAN BE IGNORED BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE NO OBSERVATIONAL CONSEQUENCES ONE MAY SAY THAT TIME HAD A BEGINNING AT THE BIG BANG IN THE SENSE THAT EARLIER TIMES SIMPLY WOULD NOT BE DEFINED IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT THIS BEGINNING IN TIME IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE THAT HAD BEEN CONSIDERED PREVIOUSLY IN AN UNCHANGING UNIVERSE A BEGINNING IN TIME IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE IMPOSED BY SOME BEING OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSE THERE IS NO PHYSICAL NECESSITY FOR A BEGINNING ONE CAN IMAGINE THAT GOD CREATED THE UNIVERSE AT LITERALLY ANY TIME IN THE PAST ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING THERE MAY BE PHYSICAL REASONS WHY THERE HAD TO BE A BEGINNING ONE COULD STILL IMAGINE THAT GOD CREATED THE UNIVERSE AT THE INSTANT OF THE BIG BANG OR EVEN AFTERWARDS IN JUST SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE IT LOOK AS THOUGH THERE HAD BEEN A BIG BANG BUT IT WOULD BE MEANINGLESS TO SUPPOSE THAT IT WAS CREATED BEFORE THE BIG BANG AN EXPANDING UNIVERSE DOES NOT PRECLUDE A CREATOR BUT IT DOES PLACE LIMITS ON WHEN HE MIGHT HAVE CARRIED OUT HIS JOB IN ORDER TO TALK ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE UNIVERSE AND TO DISCUSS QUESTIONS SUCH AS WHETHER IT HAS A BEGINNING OR AN END YOU HAVE TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT A SCIENTIFIC THEORY IS I SHALL TAKE THE SIMPLEMINDED VIEW THAT A THEORY IS JUST A MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE OR A RESTRICTED PART OF IT AND A SET OF RULES THAT RELATE QUANTITIES IN THE MODEL TO OBSERVATIONS THAT WE MAKE IT EXISTS ONLY IN OUR MINDS AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY OTHER REALITY WHATEVER THAT MIGHT MEAN A THEORY IS A GOOD THEORY IF IT SATISFIES TWO REQUIREMENTS IT MUST ACCURATELY DESCRIBE A LARGE CLASS OF OBSERVATIONS ON THE BASIS OF A MODEL THAT CONTAINS ONLY A FEW ARBITRARY ELEMENTS AND IT MUST MAKE DEFINITE PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE RESULTS OF FUTURE OBSERVATIONS FOR EXAMPLE ARISTOTLE BELIEVED EMPEDOCLESS THEORY THAT EVERYTHING WAS MADE OUT OF FOUR ELEMENTS EARTH AIR FIRE AND WATER THIS WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH BUT DID NOT MAKE ANY DEFINITE PREDICTIONS ON THE OTHER HAND NEWTONS THEORY OF GRAVITY WAS BASED ON AN EVEN SIMPLER MODEL IN WHICH BODIES ATTRACTED EACH OTHER WITH A FORCE THAT WAS PROPORTIONAL TO A QUANTITY CALLED THEIR MASS AND INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM YET IT PREDICTS THE MOTIONS OF THE SUN THE MOON AND THE PLANETS TO A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY ANY PHYSICAL THEORY IS ALWAYS PROVISIONAL IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS ONLY A HYPOTHESIS YOU CAN NEVER PROVE IT NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES THE RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS AGREE WITH SOME THEORY YOU CAN NEVER BE SURE THAT THE NEXT TIME THE RESULT WILL NOT CONTRADICT THE THEORY ON THE OTHER HAND YOU CAN DISPROVE A THEORY BY FINDING EVEN A SINGLE OBSERVATION THAT DISAGREES WITH THE PREDICTIONS OF THE THEORY AS PHILOSOPHER OF SCIENCE KARL POPPER HAS EMPHASIZED A GOOD THEORY IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE FACT THAT IT MAKES A NUMBER OF PREDICTIONS THAT COULD IN PRINCIPLE BE DISPROVED OR FALSIFIED BY OBSERVATION EACH TIME NEW EXPERIMENTS ARE OBSERVED TO AGREE WITH THE PREDICTIONS THE THEORY SURVIVES AND OUR CONFIDENCE IN IT IS INCREASED BUT IF EVER A NEW OBSERVATION IS FOUND TO DISAGREE WE HAVE TO ABANDON OR MODIFY THE THEORY AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS QUESTION THE COMPETENCE OF THE PERSON WHO CARRIED OUT THE OBSERVATION IN PRACTICE WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS IS THAT A NEW THEORY IS DEVISED THAT IS REALLY AN EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUS THEORY FOR EXAMPLE VERY ACCURATE OBSERVATIONS OF THE PLANET MERCURY REVEALED A SMALL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ITS MOTION AND THE PREDICTIONS OF NEWTONS THEORY OF GRAVITY EINSTEINS GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY PREDICTED A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MOTION FROM NEWTONS THEORY THE FACT THAT EINSTEINS PREDICTIONS MATCHED WHAT WAS SEEN WHILE NEWTONS DID NOT WAS ONE OF THE CRUCIAL CONFIRMATIONS OF THE NEW THEORY HOWEVER WE STILL USE NEWTONS THEORY FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ITS PREDICTIONS AND THOSE OF GENERAL RELATIVITY IS VERY SMALL IN THE SITUATIONS THAT WE NORMALLY DEAL WITH NEWTONS THEORY ALSO HAS THE GREAT ADVANTAGE THAT IT IS MUCH SIMPLER TO WORK WITH THAN EINSTEINS THE EVENTUAL GOAL OF SCIENCE IS TO PROVIDE A SINGLE THEORY THAT DESCRIBES THE WHOLE UNIVERSE HOWEVER THE APPROACH MOST SCIENTISTS ACTUALLY FOLLOW IS TO SEPARATE THE PROBLEM INTO TWO PARTS FIRST THERE ARE THE LAWS THAT TELL US HOW THE UNIVERSE CHANGES WITH TIME IF WE KNOW WHAT THE UNIVERSE IS LIKE AT ANY ONE TIME THESE PHYSICAL LAWS TELL US HOW IT WILL LOOK AT ANY LATER TIME SECOND THERE IS THE QUESTION OF THE INITIAL STATE OF THE UNIVERSE SOME PEOPLE FEEL THAT SCIENCE SHOULD BE CONCERNED WITH ONLY THE FIRST PART THEY REGARD THE QUESTION OF THE INITIAL SITUATION AS A MATTER FOR METAPHYSICS OR RELIGION THEY WOULD SAY THAT GOD BEING OMNIPOTENT COULD HAVE STARTED THE UNIVERSE OFF ANY WAY HE WANTED THAT MAY BE SO BUT IN THAT CASE HE ALSO COULD HAVE MADE IT DEVELOP IN A COMPLETELY ARBITRARY WAY YET IT APPEARS THAT HE CHOSE TO MAKE IT EVOLVE IN A VERY REGULAR WAY ACCORDING TO CERTAIN LAWS IT THEREFORE SEEMS EQUALLY REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT THERE ARE ALSO LAWS GOVERNING THE INITIAL STATE IT TURNS OUT TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DEVISE A THEORY TO DESCRIBE THE UNIVERSE ALL IN ONE GO INSTEAD WE BREAK THE PROBLEM UP INTO BITS AND INVENT A NUMBER OF PARTIAL THEORIES EACH OF THESE PARTIAL THEORIES DESCRIBES AND PREDICTS A CERTAIN LIMITED CLASS OF OBSERVATIONS NEGLECTING THE EFFECTS OF OTHER QUANTITIES OR REPRESENTING THEM BY SIMPLE SETS OF NUMBERS IT MAY BE THAT THIS APPROACH IS COMPLETELY WRONG IF EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE DEPENDS ON EVERYTHING ELSE IN A FUNDAMENTAL WAY IT MIGHT BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET CLOSE TO A FULL SOLUTION BY INVESTIGATING PARTS OF THE PROBLEM IN ISOLATION NEVERTHELESS IT IS CERTAINLY THE WAY THAT WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN THE PAST THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE AGAIN IS THE NEWTONIAN THEORY OF GRAVITY WHICH TELLS US THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE BETWEEN TWO BODIES DEPENDS ONLY ON ONE NUMBER ASSOCIATED WITH EACH BODY ITS MASS BUT IS OTHERWISE INDEPENDENT OF WHAT THE BODIES ARE MADE OF THUS ONE DOES NOT NEED TO HAVE A THEORY OF THE STRUCTURE AND CONSTITUTION OF THE SUN AND THE PLANETS IN ORDER TO CALCULATE THEIR ORBITS TODAY SCIENTISTS DESCRIBE THE UNIVERSE IN TERMS OF TWO BASIC PARTIAL THEORIES THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS THEY ARE THE GREAT INTELLECTUAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE FIRST HALF OF THIS CENTURY THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY DESCRIBES THE FORCE OF GRAVITY AND THE LARGESCALE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE THAT IS THE STRUCTURE ON SCALES FROM ONLY A FEW MILES TO AS LARGE AS A MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION WITH TWENTYFOUR ZEROS AFTER IT MILES THE SIZE OF THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE QUANTUM MECHANICS ON THE OTHER HAND DEALS WITH PHENOMENA ON EXTREMELY SMALL SCALES SUCH AS A MILLIONTH OF A MILLIONTH OF AN INCH UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER THESE TWO THEORIES ARE KNOWN TO BE INCONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER THEY CANNOT BOTH BE CORRECT ONE OF THE MAJOR ENDEAVORS IN PHYSICS TODAY AND THE MAJOR THEME OF THIS BOOK IS THE SEARCH FOR A NEW THEORY THAT WILL INCORPORATE THEM BOTH A QUANTUM THEORY OF GRAVITY WE DO NOT YET HAVE SUCH A THEORY AND WE MAY STILL BE A LONG WAY FROM HAVING ONE BUT WE DO ALREADY KNOW MANY OF THE PROPERTIES THAT IT MUST HAVE AND WE SHALL SEE IN LATER CHAPTERS THAT WE ALREADY KNOW A FAIR AMOUNT ABOUT THE PREDICATIONS A QUANTUM THEORY OF GRAVITY MUST MAKE NOW IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NOT ARBITRARY BUT IS GOVERNED BY DEFINITE LAWS YOU ULTIMATELY HAVE TO COMBINE THE PARTIAL THEORIES INTO A COMPLETE UNIFIED THEORY THAT WILL DESCRIBE EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE BUT THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL PARADOX IN THE SEARCH FOR SUCH A COMPLETE UNIFIED THEORY THE IDEAS ABOUT SCIENTIFIC THEORIES OUTLINED ABOVE ASSUME WE ARE RATIONAL BEINGS WHO ARE FREE TO OBSERVE THE UNIVERSE AS WE WANT AND TO DRAW LOGICAL DEDUCTIONS FROM WHAT WE SEE IN SUCH A SCHEME IT IS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT WE MIGHT PROGRESS EVER CLOSER TOWARD THE LAWS THAT GOVERN OUR UNIVERSE YET IF THERE REALLY IS A COMPLETE UNIFIED THEORY IT WOULD ALSO PRESUMABLY DETERMINE OUR ACTIONS AND SO THE THEORY ITSELF WOULD DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF OUR SEARCH FOR IT AND WHY SHOULD IT DETERMINE THAT WE COME TO THE RIGHT CONCLUSIONS FROM THE EVIDENCE MIGHT IT NOT EQUALLY WELL DETERMINE THAT WE DRAW THE WRONG CONCLUSION OR NO CONCLUSION AT ALL THE ONLY ANSWER THAT I CAN GIVE TO THIS PROBLEM IS BASED ON DARWINS PRINCIPLE OF NATURAL SELECTION THE IDEA IS THAT IN ANY POPULATION OF SELFREPRODUCING ORGANISMS THERE WILL BE VARIATIONS IN THE GENETIC MATERIAL AND UPBRINGING THAT DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS HAVE THESE DIFFERENCES WILL MEAN THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS ARE BETTER ABLE THAN OTHERS TO DRAW THE RIGHT CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE WORLD AROUND THEM AND TO ACT ACCORDINGLY THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO SURVIVE AND REPRODUCE AND SO THEIR PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR AND THOUGHT WILL COME TO DOMINATE IT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN TRUE IN THE PAST THAT WHAT WE CALL INTELLIGENCE AND SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY HAVE CONVEYED A SURVIVAL ADVANTAGE IT IS NOT SO CLEAR THAT THIS IS STILL THE CASE OUR SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES MAY WELL DESTROY US ALL AND EVEN IF THEY DONT A COMPLETE UNIFIED THEORY MAY NOT MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE TO OUR CHANCES OF SURVIVAL HOWEVER PROVIDED THE UNIVERSE HAS EVOLVED IN A REGULAR WAY WE MIGHT EXPECT THAT THE REASONING ABILITIES THAT NATURAL SELECTION HAS GIVEN US WOULD BE VALID ALSO IN OUR SEARCH FOR A COMPLETE UNIFIED THEORY AND SO WOULD NOT LEAD US TO THE WRONG CONCLUSIONS BECAUSE THE PARTIAL THEORIES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE ARE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS IN ALL BUT THE MOST EXTREME SITUATIONS THE SEARCH FOR THE ULTIMATE THEORY OF THE UNIVERSE SEEMS DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY ON PRACTICAL GROUNDS IT IS WORTH NOTING THOUGH THAT SIMILAR ARGUMENTS COULD HAVE BEEN USED AGAINST BOTH RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS AND THESE THEORIES HAVE GIVEN US BOTH NUCLEAR ENERGY AND THE MICROELECTRONICS REVOLUTION THE DISCOVERY OF A COMPLETE UNIFIED THEORY THEREFORE MAY NOT AID THE SURVIVAL OF OUR SPECIES IT MAY NOT EVEN AFFECT OUR LIFESTYLE BUT EVER SINCE THE DAWN OF CIVILIZATION PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN CONTENT TO SEE EVENTS AS UNCONNECTED AND INEXPLICABLE THEY HAVE CRAVED AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING ORDER IN THE WORLD TODAY WE STILL YEARN TO KNOW WHY WE ARE HERE AND WHERE WE CAME FROM HUMANITYS DEEPEST DESIRE FOR KNOWLEDGE IS JUSTIFICATION ENOUGH FOR OUR CONTINUING QUEST AND OUR GOAL IS NOTHING LESS THAN A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE UNIVERSE WE LIVE IN OUR PRESENT IDEAS ABOUT THE MOTION OF BODIES DATE BACK TO GALILEO AND NEWTON BEFORE THEM PEOPLE BELIEVED ARISTOTLE WHO SAID THAT THE NATURAL STATE OF A BODY WAS TO BE AT REST AND THAT IT MOVED ONLY IF DRIVEN BY A FORCE OR IMPULSE IT FOLLOWED THAT A HEAVY BODY SHOULD FALL FASTER THAN A LIGHT ONE BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE A GREATER PULL TOWARD THE EARTH THE ARISTOTELIAN TRADITION ALSO HELD THAT ONE COULD WORK OUT ALL THE LAWS THAT GOVERN THE UNIVERSE BY PURE THOUGHT IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO CHECK BY OBSERVATION SO NO ONE UNTIL GALILEO BOTHERED TO SEE WHETHER BODIES OF DIFFERENT WEIGHT DID IN FACT FALL AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS IT IS SAID THAT GALILEO DEMONSTRATED THAT ARISTOTLES BELIEF WAS FALSE BY DROPPING WEIGHTS FROM THE LEANING TOWER OF PISA THE STORY IS ALMOST CERTAINLY UNTRUE BUT GALILEO DID DO SOMETHING EQUIVALENT HE ROLLED BALLS OF DIFFERENT WEIGHTS DOWN A SMOOTH SLOPE THE SITUATION IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF HEAVY BODIES FALLING VERTICALLY BUT IT IS EASIER TO OBSERVE BECAUSE THE SPEEDS ARE SMALLER GALILEOS MEASUREMENTS INDICATED THAT EACH BODY INCREASED ITS SPEED AT THE SAME RATE NO MATTER WHAT ITS WEIGHT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LET GO OF A BALL ON A SLOPE THAT DROPS BY ONE METER FOR EVERY TEN METERS YOU GO ALONG THE BALL WILL BE TRAVELING DOWN THE SLOPE AT A SPEED OF ABOUT ONE METER PER SECOND AFTER ONE SECOND TWO METERS PER SECOND AFTER TWO SECONDS AND SO ON HOWEVER HEAVY THE BALL OF COURSE A LEAD WEIGHT WOULD FALL FASTER THAN A FEATHER BUT THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE A FEATHER IS SLOWED DOWN BY AIR RESISTANCE IF ONE DROPS TWO BODIES THAT DONT HAVE MUCH AIR RESISTANCE SUCH AS TWO DIFFERENT LEAD WEIGHTS THEY FALL AT THE SAME RATE ON THE MOON WHERE THERE IS NO AIR TO SLOW THINGS DOWN THE ASTRONAUT DAVID R SCOTT PERFORMED THE FEATHER AND LEAD WEIGHT EXPERIMENT AND FOUND THAT INDEED THEY DID HIT THE GROUND AT THE SAME TIME GALILEOS MEASUREMENTS WERE USED BY NEWTON AS THE BASIS OF HIS LAWS OF MOTION IN GALILEOS EXPERIMENTS AS A BODY ROLLED DOWN THE SLOPE IT WAS ALWAYS ACTED ON BY THE SAME FORCE ITS WEIGHT AND THE EFFECT WAS TO MAKE IT CONSTANTLY SPEED UP THIS SHOWED THAT THE REAL EFFECT OF A FORCE IS ALWAYS TO CHANGE THE SPEED OF A BODY RATHER THAN JUST TO SET IT MOVING AS WAS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT IT ALSO MEANT THAT WHENEVER A BODY IS NOT ACTED ON BY ANY FORCE IT WILL KEEP ON MOVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE AT THE SAME SPEED THIS IDEA WAS FIRST STATED EXPLICITLY IN NEWTONS PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA PUBLISHED IN AND IS KNOWN AS NEWTONS FIRST LAW WHAT HAPPENS TO A BODY WHEN A FORCE DOES ACT ON IT IS GIVEN BY NEWTONS SECOND LAW THIS STATES THAT THE BODY WILL ACCELERATE OR CHANGE ITS SPEED AT A RATE THAT IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE FORCE FOR EXAMPLE THE ACCELERATION IS TWICE AS GREAT IF THE FORCE IS TWICE AS GREAT THE ACCELERATION IS ALSO SMALLER THE GREATER THE MASS OR QUANTITY OF MATTER OF THE BODY THE SAME FORCE ACTING ON A BODY OF TWICE THE MASS WILL PRODUCE HALF THE ACCELERATION A FAMILIAR EXAMPLE IS PROVIDED BY A CAR THE MORE POWERFUL THE ENGINE THE GREATER THE ACCELERATION BUT THE HEAVIER THE CAR THE SMALLER THE ACCELERATION FOR THE SAME ENGINE IN ADDITION TO HIS LAWS OF MOTION NEWTON DISCOVERED A LAW TO DESCRIBE THE FORCE OF GRAVITY WHICH STATES THAT EVERY BODY ATTRACTS EVERY OTHER BODY WITH A FORCE THAT IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE MASS OF EACH BODY THUS THE FORCE BETWEEN TWO BODIES WOULD BE TWICE AS STRONG IF ONE OF THE BODIES SAY BODY A HAD ITS MASS DOUBLED THIS IS WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT BECAUSE ONE COULD THINK OF THE NEW BODY A AS BEING MADE OF TWO BODIES WITH THE ORIGINAL MASS EACH WOULD ATTRACT BODY B WITH THE ORIGINAL FORCE THUS THE TOTAL FORCE BETWEEN A AND B WOULD BE TWICE THE ORIGINAL FORCE AND IF SAY ONE OF THE BODIES HAD TWICE THE MASS AND THE OTHER HAD THREE TIMES THE MASS THEN THE FORCE WOULD BE SIX TIMES AS STRONG ONE CAN NOW SEE WHY ALL BODIES FALL AT THE SAME RATE A BODY OF TWICE THE WEIGHT WILL HAVE TWICE THE FORCE OF GRAVITY PULLING IT DOWN BUT IT WILL ALSO HAVE TWICE THE MASS ACCORDING TO NEWTONS SECOND LAW THESE TWO EFFECTS WILL EXACTLY CANCEL EACH OTHER SO THE ACCELERATION WILL BE THE SAME IN ALL CASES NEWTONS LAW OF GRAVITY ALSO TELLS US THAT THE FARTHER APART THE BODIES THE SMALLER THE FORCE NEWTONS LAW OF GRAVITY SAYS THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION OF A STAR IS EXACTLY ONE QUARTER THAT OF A SIMILAR STAR AT HALF THE DISTANCE THIS LAW PREDICTS THE ORBITS OF THE EARTH THE MOON AND THE PLANETS WITH GREAT ACCURACY IF THE LAW WERE THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION OF A STAR WENT DOWN FASTER OR INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY WITH DISTANCE THE ORBITS OF THE PLANETS WOULD NOT BE ELLIPTICAL THEY WOULD EITHER SPIRAL IN TO THE SUN OR ESCAPE FROM THE SUN THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IDEAS OF ARISTOTLE AND THOSE OF GALILEO AND NEWTON IS THAT ARISTOTLE BELIEVED IN A PREFERRED STATE OF REST WHICH ANY BODY WOULD TAKE UP IF IT WERE NOT DRIVEN BY SOME FORCE OR IMPULSE IN PARTICULAR HE THOUGHT THAT THE EARTH WAS AT REST BUT IT FOLLOWS FROM NEWTONS LAWS THAT THERE IS NO UNIQUE STANDARD OF REST ONE COULD EQUALLY WELL SAY THAT BODY A WAS AT REST AND BODY B WAS MOVING AT CONSTANT SPEED WITH RESPECT TO BODY A OR THAT BODY B WAS AT REST AND BODY A WAS MOVING FOR EXAMPLE IF ONE SETS ASIDE FOR A MOMENT THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH AND ITS ORBIT ROUND THE SUN ONE COULD SAY THAT THE EARTH WAS AT REST AND THAT A TRAIN ON IT WAS TRAVELING NORTH AT NINETY MILES PER HOUR OR THAT THE TRAIN WAS AT REST AND THE EARTH WAS MOVING SOUTH AT NINETY MILES PER HOUR IF ONE CARRIED OUT EXPERIMENTS WITH MOVING BODIES ON THE TRAIN ALL NEWTONS LAWS WOULD STILL HOLD FOR INSTANCE PLAYING PINGPONG ON THE TRAIN ONE WOULD FIND THAT THE BALL OBEYED NEWTONS LAWS JUST LIKE A BALL ON A TABLE BY THE TRACK SO THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL WHETHER IT IS THE TRAIN OR THE EARTH THAT IS MOVING THE LACK OF AN ABSOLUTE STANDARD OF REST MEANT THAT ONE COULD NOT DETERMINE WHETHER TWO EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE AT DIFFERENT TIMES OCCURRED IN THE SAME POSITION IN SPACE FOR EXAMPLE SUPPOSE OUR PINGPONG BALL ON THE TRAIN BOUNCES STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN HITTING THE TABLE TWICE ON THE SAME SPOT ONE SECOND APART TO SOMEONE ON THE TRACK THE TWO BOUNCES WOULD SEEM TO TAKE PLACE ABOUT FORTY METERS APART BECAUSE THE TRAIN WOULD HAVE TRAVELED THAT FAR DOWN THE TRACK BETWEEN THE BOUNCES THE NONEXISTENCE OF ABSOLUTE REST THEREFORE MEANT THAT ONE COULD NOT GIVE AN EVENT AN ABSOLUTE POSITION IN SPACE AS ARISTOTLE HAD BELIEVED THE POSITIONS OF EVENTS AND THE DISTANCES BETWEEN THEM WOULD BE DIFFERENT FOR A PERSON ON THE TRAIN AND ONE ON THE TRACK AND THERE WOULD BE NO REASON TO PREFER ONE PERSONS POSITION TO THE OTHERS NEWTON WAS VERY WORRIED BY THIS LACK OF ABSOLUTE POSITION OR ABSOLUTE SPACE AS IT WAS CALLED BECAUSE IT DID NOT ACCORD WITH HIS IDEA OF AN ABSOLUTE GOD IN FACT HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT LACK OF ABSOLUTE SPACE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS IMPLIED BY HIS LAWS HE WAS SEVERELY CRITICIZED FOR THIS IRRATIONAL BELIEF BY MANY PEOPLE MOST NOTABLY BY BISHOP BERKELEY A PHILOSOPHER WHO BELIEVED THAT ALL MATERIAL OBJECTS AND SPACE AND TIME ARE AN ILLUSION WHEN THE FAMOUS DR JOHNSON WAS TOLD OF BERKELEYS OPINION HE CRIED I REFUTE IT THUS AND STUBBED HIS TOE ON A LARGE STONE BOTH ARISTOTLE AND NEWTON BELIEVED IN ABSOLUTE TIME THAT IS THEY BELIEVED THAT ONE COULD UNAMBIGUOUSLY MEASURE THE INTERVAL OF TIME BETWEEN TWO EVENTS AND THAT THIS TIME WOULD BE THE SAME WHOEVER MEASURED IT PROVIDED THEY USED A GOOD CLOCK TIME WAS COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM AND INDEPENDENT OF SPACE THIS IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD TAKE TO BE THE COMMONSENSE VIEW HOWEVER WE HAVE HAD TO CHANGE OUR IDEAS ABOUT SPACE AND TIME ALTHOUGH OUR APPARENTLY COMMONSENSE NOTIONS WORK WELL WHEN DEALING WITH THINGS LIKE APPLES OR PLANETS THAT TRAVEL COMPARATIVELY SLOWLY THEY DONT WORK AT ALL FOR THINGS MOVING AT OR NEAR THE SPEED OF LIGHT THE FACT THAT LIGHT TRAVELS AT A FINITE BUT VERY HIGH SPEED WAS FIRST DISCOVERED IN BY THE DANISH ASTRONOMER OLE CHRISTENSEN ROEMER HE OBSERVED THAT THE TIMES AT WHICH THE MOONS OF JUPITER APPEARED TO PASS BEHIND JUPITER WERE NOT EVENLY SPACED AS ONE WOULD EXPECT IF THE MOONS WENT ROUND JUPITER AT A CONSTANT RATE AS THE EARTH AND JUPITER ORBIT AROUND THE SUN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM VARIES ROEMER NOTICED THAT ECLIPSES OF JUPITERS MOONS APPEARED LATER THE FARTHER WE WERE FROM JUPITER HE ARGUED THAT THIS WAS BECAUSE THE LIGHT FROM THE MOONS TOOK LONGER TO REACH US WHEN WE WERE FARTHER AWAY HIS MEASUREMENTS OF THE VARIATIONS IN THE DISTANCE OF THE EARTH FROM JUPITER WERE HOWEVER NOT VERY ACCURATE AND SO HIS VALUE FOR THE SPEED OF LIGHT WAS  MILES PER SECOND COMPARED TO THE MODERN VALUE OF MILES PER SECOND NEVERTHELESS ROEMERS ACHIEVEMENT IN NOT ONLY PROVING THAT LIGHT TRAVELS AT A FINITE SPEED BUT ALSO IN MEASURING THAT SPEED WAS REMARKABLE COMING AS IT DID ELEVEN YEARS BEFORE NEWTONS PUBLICATION OF PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA A PROPER THEORY OF THE PROPAGATION OF LIGHT DIDNT COME UNTIL WHEN THE BRITISH PHYSICIST JAMES CLERK MAXWELL SUCCEEDED IN UNIFYING THE PARTIAL THEORIES THAT UP TO THEN HAD BEEN USED TO DESCRIBE THE FORCES OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM MAXWELLS EQUATIONS PREDICTED THAT THERE COULD BE WAVELIKE DISTURBANCES IN THE COMBINED ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD AND THAT THESE WOULD TRAVEL AT A FIXED SPEED LIKE RIPPLES ON A POND IF THE WAVELENGTH OF THESE WAVES THE DISTANCE BETWEEN ONE WAVE CREST AND THE NEXT IS A METER OR MORE THEY ARE WHAT WE NOW CALL RADIO WAVES SHORTER WAVELENGTHS ARE KNOWN AS MICROWAVES A FEW CENTIMETERS OR INFRARED MORE THAN A TENTHOUSANDTH OF A CENTIMETER VISIBLE LIGHT HAS A WAVELENGTH OF BETWEEN ONLY FORTY AND EIGHTY MILLIONTHS OF A CENTIMETER EVEN SHORTER WAVELENGTHS ARE KNOWN AS ULTRAVIOLET X RAYS AND GAMMA RAYS MAXWELLS THEORY PREDICTED THAT RADIO OR LIGHT WAVES SHOULD TRAVEL AT A CERTAIN FIXED SPEED BUT NEWTONS THEORY HAD GOT RID OF THE IDEA OF ABSOLUTE REST SO IF LIGHT WAS SUPPOSED TO TRAVEL AT A FIXED SPEED ONE WOULD HAVE TO SAY WHAT THAT FIXED SPEED WAS TO BE MEASURED RELATIVE TO IT WAS THEREFORE SUGGESTED THAT THERE WAS A SUBSTANCE CALLED THE ETHER THAT WAS PRESENT EVERYWHERE EVEN IN EMPTY SPACE LIGHT WAVES SHOULD TRAVEL THROUGH THE ETHER AS SOUND WAVES TRAVEL THROUGH AIR AND THEIR SPEED SHOULD THEREFORE BE RELATIVE TO THE ETHER DIFFERENT OBSERVERS MOVING RELATIVE TO THE ETHER WOULD SEE LIGHT COMING TOWARD THEM AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS BUT LIGHTS SPEED RELATIVE TO THE ETHER WOULD REMAIN FIXED IN PARTICULAR AS THE EARTH WAS MOVING THROUGH THE ETHER ON ITS ORBIT ROUND THE SUN THE SPEED OF LIGHT MEASURED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE EARTHS MOTION THROUGH THE ETHER WHEN WE WERE MOVING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF THE LIGHT SHOULD BE HIGHER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THAT MOTION WHEN WE ARE NOT MOVING TOWARD THE SOURCE IN  ALBERT MICHELSON WHO LATER BECAME THE FIRST AMERICAN TO RECEIVE THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR PHYSICS AND EDWARD MORLEY CARRIED OUT A VERY CAREFUL EXPERIMENT AT THE CASE SCHOOL OF APPLIED SCIENCE IN CLEVELAND THEY COMPARED THE SPEED OF LIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE EARTHS MOTION WITH THAT AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE EARTHS MOTION TO THEIR GREAT SURPRISE THEY FOUND THEY WERE EXACTLY THE SAME BETWEEN AND THERE WERE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS MOST NOTABLY BY THE DUTCH PHYSICIST HENDRIK LORENTZ TO EXPLAIN THE RESULT OF THE MICHELSONMORLEY EXPERIMENT IN TERMS OF OBJECTS CONTRACTING AND CLOCKS SLOWING DOWN WHEN THEY MOVED THROUGH THE ETHER HOWEVER IN A FAMOUS PAPER IN A HITHERTO UNKNOWN CLERK IN THE SWISS PATENT OFFICE ALBERT EINSTEIN POINTED OUT THAT THE WHOLE IDEA OF AN ETHER WAS UNNECESSARY PROVIDING ONE WAS WILLING TO ABANDON THE IDEA OF ABSOLUTE TIME A SIMILAR POINT WAS MADE A FEW WEEKS LATER BY A LEADING FRENCH MATHEMATICIAN HENRI POINCARE EINSTEINS ARGUMENTS WERE CLOSER TO PHYSICS THAN THOSE OF POINCARE WHO REGARDED THIS PROBLEM AS MATHEMATICAL EINSTEIN IS USUALLY GIVEN THE CREDIT FOR THE NEW THEORY BUT POINCARE IS REMEMBERED BY HAVING HIS NAME ATTACHED TO AN IMPORTANT PART OF IT THE FUNDAMENTAL POSTULATE OF THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY AS IT WAS CALLED WAS THAT THE LAWS OF SCIENCE SHOULD BE THE SAME FOR ALL FREELY MOVING OBSERVERS NO MATTER WHAT THEIR SPEED THIS WAS TRUE FOR NEWTONS LAWS OF MOTION BUT NOW THE IDEA WAS EXTENDED TO INCLUDE MAXWELLS THEORY AND THE SPEED OF LIGHT ALL OBSERVERS SHOULD MEASURE THE SAME SPEED OF LIGHT NO MATTER HOW FAST THEY ARE MOVING THIS SIMPLE IDEA HAS SOME REMARKABLE CONSEQUENCES PERHAPS THE BEST KNOWN ARE THE EQUIVALENCE OF MASS AND ENERGY SUMMED UP IN EINSTEINS FAMOUS EQUATION EMC WHERE E IS ENERGY M IS MASS AND C IS THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND THE LAW THAT NOTHING MAY TRAVEL FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT BECAUSE OF THE EQUIVALENCE OF ENERGY AND MASS THE ENERGY WHICH AN OBJECT HAS DUE TO ITS MOTION WILL ADD TO ITS MASS IN OTHER WORDS IT WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO INCREASE ITS SPEED THIS EFFECT IS ONLY REALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR OBJECTS MOVING AT SPEEDS CLOSE TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT FOR EXAMPLE AT  PERCENT OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT AN OBJECTS MASS IS ONLY PERCENT MORE THAN NORMAL WHILE AT PERCENT OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT IT WOULD BE MORE THAN TWICE ITS NORMAL MASS AS AN OBJECT APPROACHES THE SPEED OF LIGHT ITS MASS RISES EVER MORE QUICKLY SO IT TAKES MORE AND MORE ENERGY TO SPEED IT UP FURTHER IT CAN IN FACT NEVER REACH THE SPEED OF LIGHT BECAUSE BY THEN ITS MASS WOULD HAVE BECOME INFINITE AND BY THE EQUIVALENCE OF MASS AND ENERGY IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO GET IT THERE FOR THIS REASON ANY NORMAL OBJECT IS FOREVER CONFINED BY RELATIVITY TO MOVE AT SPEEDS SLOWER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT ONLY LIGHT OR OTHER WAVES THAT HAVE NO INTRINSIC MASS CAN MOVE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT AN EQUALLY REMARKABLE CONSEQUENCE OF RELATIVITY IS THE WAY IT HAS REVOLUTIONIZED OUR IDEAS OF SPACE AND TIME IN NEWTONS THEORY IF A PULSE OF LIGHT IS SENT FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER DIFFERENT OBSERVERS WOULD AGREE ON THE TIME THAT THE JOURNEY TOOK SINCE TIME IS ABSOLUTE BUT WILL NOT ALWAYS AGREE ON HOW FAR THE LIGHT TRAVELED SINCE SPACE IS NOT ABSOLUTE SINCE THE SPEED OF THE LIGHT IS JUST THE DISTANCE IT HAS TRAVELED DIVIDED BY THE TIME IT HAS TAKEN DIFFERENT OBSERVERS WOULD MEASURE DIFFERENT SPEEDS FOR THE LIGHT IN RELATIVITY ON THE OTHER HAND ALL OBSERVERS MUST AGREE ON HOW FAST LIGHT TRAVELS THEY STILL HOWEVER DO NOT AGREE ON THE DISTANCE THE LIGHT HAS TRAVELED SO THEY MUST THEREFORE NOW ALSO DISAGREE OVER THE TIME IT HAS TAKEN THE TIME TAKEN IS THE DISTANCE THE LIGHT HAS TRAVELED WHICH THE OBSERVERS DO NOT AGREE ON DIVIDED BY THE LIGHTS SPEED WHICH THEY DO AGREE ON IN OTHER WORDS THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY PUT AN END TO THE IDEA OF ABSOLUTE TIME IT APPEARED THAT EACH OBSERVER MUST HAVE HIS OWN MEASURE OF TIME AS RECORDED BY A CLOCK CARRIED WITH HIM AND THAT IDENTICAL CLOCKS CARRIED BY DIFFERENT OBSERVERS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY AGREE EACH OBSERVER COULD USE RADAR TO SAY WHERE AND WHEN AN EVENT TOOK PLACE BY SENDING OUT A PULSE OF LIGHT OR RADIO WAVES PART OF THE PULSE IS REFLECTED BACK AT THE EVENT AND THE OBSERVER MEASURES THE TIME AT WHICH HE RECEIVES THE ECHO THE TIME OF THE EVENT IS THEN SAID TO BE THE TIME HALFWAY BETWEEN WHEN THE PULSE WAS SENT AND THE TIME WHEN THE REFLECTION WAS RECEIVED BACK THE DISTANCE OF THE EVENT IS HALF THE TIME TAKEN FOR THIS ROUND TRIP MULTIPLIED BY THE SPEED OF LIGHT AN EVENT IN THIS SENSE IS SOMETHING THAT TAKES PLACE AT A SINGLE POINT IN SPACE AT A SPECIFIED POINT IN TIME THIS IDEA IS SHOWN HERE WHICH IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SPACETIME DIAGRAM USING THIS PROCEDURE OBSERVERS WHO ARE MOVING RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER WILL ASSIGN DIFFERENT TIMES AND POSITIONS TO THE SAME EVENT NO PARTICULAR OBSERVERS MEASUREMENTS ARE ANY MORE CORRECT THAN ANY OTHER OBSERVERS BUT ALL THE MEASUREMENTS ARE RELATED ANY OBSERVER CAN WORK OUT PRECISELY WHAT TIME AND POSITION ANY OTHER OBSERVER WILL ASSIGN TO AN EVENT PROVIDED HE KNOWS THE OTHER OBSERVERS RELATIVE VELOCITY NOWADAYS WE USE JUST THIS METHOD TO MEASURE DISTANCES PRECISELY BECAUSE WE CAN MEASURE TIME MORE ACCURATELY THAN LENGTH IN EFFECT THE METER IS DEFINED TO BE THE DISTANCE TRAVELED BY LIGHT IN  SECOND AS MEASURED BY A CESIUM CLOCK THE REASON FOR THAT PARTICULAR NUMBER IS THAT IT CORRESPONDS TO THE HISTORICAL DEFINITION OF THE METER IN TERMS OF TWO MARKS ON A PARTICULAR PLATINUM BAR KEPT IN PARIS EQUALLY WE CAN USE A MORE CONVENIENT NEW UNIT OF LENGTH CALLED A LIGHTSECOND THIS IS SIMPLY DEFINED AS THE DISTANCE THAT LIGHT TRAVELS IN ONE SECOND IN THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY WE NOW DEFINE DISTANCE IN TERMS OF TIME AND THE SPEED OF LIGHT SO IT FOLLOWS AUTOMATICALLY THAT EVERY OBSERVER WILL MEASURE LIGHT TO HAVE THE SAME SPEED BY DEFINITION METER PER SECOND THERE IS NO NEED TO INTRODUCE THE IDEA OF AN ETHER WHOSE PRESENCE ANYWAY CANNOT BE DETECTED AS THE MICHELSONMORLEY EXPERIMENT SHOWED THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY DOES HOWEVER FORCE US TO CHANGE FUNDAMENTALLY OUR IDEAS OF SPACE AND TIME WE MUST ACCEPT THAT TIME IS NOT COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM AND INDEPENDENT OF SPACE BUT IS COMBINED WITH IT TO FORM AN OBJECT CALLED SPACETIME IT IS A MATTER OF COMMON EXPERIENCE THAT ONE CAN DESCRIBE THE POSITION OF A POINT IN SPACE BY THREE NUMBERS OR COORDINATES FOR INSTANCE ONE CAN SAY THAT A POINT IN A ROOM IS SEVEN FEET FROM ONE WALL THREE FEET FROM ANOTHER AND FIVE FEET ABOVE THE FLOOR OR ONE COULD SPECIFY THAT A POINT WAS AT A CERTAIN LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE AND A CERTAIN HEIGHT ABOVE SEA LEVEL ONE IS FREE TO USE ANY THREE SUITABLE COORDINATES ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE ONLY A LIMITED RANGE OF VALIDITY ONE WOULD NOT SPECIFY THE POSITION OF THE MOON IN TERMS OF MILES NORTH AND MILES WEST OF PICCADILLY CIRCUS AND FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL INSTEAD ONE MIGHT DESCRIBE IT IN TERMS OF DISTANCE FROM THE SUN DISTANCE FROM THE PLANE OF THE ORBITS OF THE PLANETS AND THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE LINE JOINING THE MOON TO THE SUN AND THE LINE JOINING THE SUN TO A NEARBY STAR SUCH AS ALPHA CENTAURI EVEN THESE COORDINATES WOULD NOT BE OF MUCH USE IN DESCRIBING THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN OUR GALAXY OR THE POSITION OF OUR GALAXY IN THE LOCAL GROUP OF GALAXIES IN FACT ONE MAY DESCRIBE THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IN TERMS OF A COLLECTION OF OVERLAPPING PATCHES IN EACH PATCH ONE CAN USE A DIFFERENT SET OF THREE COORDINATES TO SPECIFY THE POSITION OF A POINT AN EVENT IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN SPACE AND AT A PARTICULAR TIME SO ONE CAN SPECIFY IT BY FOUR NUMBERS OR COORDINATES AGAIN THE CHOICE OF COORDINATES IS ARBITRARY ONE CAN USE ANY THREE WELLDEFINED SPATIAL COORDINATES AND ANY MEASURE OF TIME IN RELATIVITY THERE IS NO REAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE SPACE AND TIME COORDINATES JUST AS THERE IS NO REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANY TWO SPACE COORDINATES ONE COULD CHOOSE A NEW SET OF COORDINATES IN WHICH SAY THE FIRST SPACE COORDINATE WAS A COMBINATION OF THE OLD FIRST AND SECOND SPACE COORDINATES FOR INSTANCE INSTEAD OF MEASURING THE POSITION OF A POINT ON THE EARTH IN MILES NORTH OF PICCADILLY AND MILES WEST OF PICCADILLY ONE COULD USE MILES NORTHEAST OF PICCADILLY AND MILES NORTHWEST OF PICCADILLY SIMILARLY IN RELATIVITY ONE COULD USE A NEW TIME COORDINATE THAT WAS THE OLD TIME IN SECONDS PLUS THE DISTANCE IN LIGHTSECONDS NORTH OF PICCADILLY IT IS OFTEN HELPFUL TO THINK OF THE FOUR COORDINATES OF AN EVENT AS SPECIFYING ITS POSITION IN A FOURDIMENSIONAL SPACE CALLED SPACETIME IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE A FOURDIMENSIONAL SPACE I PERSONALLY FIND IT HARD ENOUGH TO VISUALIZE THREEDIMENSIONAL SPACE HOWEVER IT IS EASY TO DRAW DIAGRAMS OF TWODIMENSIONAL SPACES SUCH AS THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IS TWODIMENSIONAL BECAUSE THE POSITION OF A POINT CAN BE SPECIFIED BY TWO COORDINATES LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE I SHALL GENERALLY USE DIAGRAMS IN WHICH TIME INCREASES UPWARD AND ONE OF THE SPATIAL DIMENSIONS IS SHOWN HORIZONTALLY THE OTHER TWO SPATIAL DIMENSIONS ARE IGNORED OR SOMETIMES ONE OF THEM IS INDICATED BY PERSPECTIVE FOR EXAMPLE IN FIGURE TIME IS MEASURED UPWARD IN YEARS AND THE DISTANCE ALONG THE LINE FROM THE SUN TO ALPHA CENTAURI IS MEASURED HORIZONTALLY IN MILES THE PATHS OF THE SUN AND OF ALPHA CENTAURI THROUGH SPACETIME ARE SHOWN AS THE VERTICAL LINES ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT OF THE DIAGRAM A RAY OF LIGHT FROM THE SUN FOLLOWS THE DIAGONAL LINE AND TAKES FOUR YEARS TO GET FROM THE SUN TO ALPHA CENTAURI AS WE HAVE SEEN MAXWELLS EQUATIONS PREDICTED THAT THE SPEED OF LIGHT SHOULD BE THE SAME WHATEVER THE SPEED OF THE SOURCE AND THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS IT FOLLOWS FROM THIS THAT IF A PULSE OF LIGHT IS EMITTED AT A PARTICULAR TIME AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN SPACE THEN AS TIME GOES ON IT WILL SPREAD OUT AS A SPHERE OF LIGHT WHOSE SIZE AND POSITION ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE SPEED OF THE SOURCE AFTER ONE MILLIONTH OF A SECOND THE LIGHT WILL HAVE SPREAD OUT TO FORM A SPHERE WITH A RADIUS OF METERS AFTER TWO MILLIONTHS OF A SECOND THE RADIUS WILL BE METERS AND SO ON IT WILL BE LIKE THE RIPPLES THAT SPREAD OUT ON THE SURFACE OF A POND WHEN A STONE IS THROWN IN THE RIPPLES SPREAD OUT AS A CIRCLE THAT GETS BIGGER AS TIME GOES ON IF ONE STACKS SNAPSHOTS OF THE RIPPLES AT DIFFERENT TIMES ONE ABOVE THE OTHER THE EXPANDING CIRCLE OF RIPPLES WILL MARK OUT A CONE WHOSE TIP IS AT THE PLACE AND TIME AT WHICH THE STONE HIT THE WATER WE WOULD KNOW ABOUT IT ONLY AFTER EIGHT MINUTES THE TIME IT TAKES LIGHT TO REACH US FROM THE SUN ONLY THEN WOULD EVENTS ON EARTH LIE IN THE FUTURE LIGHT CONE OF THE EVENT AT WHICH THE SUN WENT OUT SIMILARLY WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT FARTHER AWAY IN THE UNIVERSE THE LIGHT THAT WE SEE FROM DISTANT GALAXIES LEFT THEM MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO AND IN THE CASE OF THE MOST DISTANT OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT LEFT SOME EIGHT THOUSAND MILLION YEARS AGO THUS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE UNIVERSE WE ARE SEEING IT AS IT WAS IN THE PAST IF ONE NEGLECTS GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS AS EINSTEIN AND POINCARE DID IN ONE HAS WHAT IS CALLED THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY FOR EVERY EVENT IN SPACETIME WE MAY CONSTRUCT A LIGHT CONE THE SET OF ALL POSSIBLE PATHS OF LIGHT IN SPACETIME EMITTED AT THAT EVENT AND SINCE THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS THE SAME AT EVERY EVENT AND IN EVERY DIRECTION ALL THE LIGHT CONES WILL BE IDENTICAL AND WILL ALL POINT IN THE SAME DIRECTION THE THEORY ALSO TELLS US THAT NOTHING CAN TRAVEL FASTER THAN LIGHT THIS MEANS THAT THE PATH OF ANY OBJECT THROUGH SPACE AND TIME MUST BE REPRESENTED BY A LINE THAT LIES WITHIN THE LIGHT CONE AT EACH EVENT ON IT FIG THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL IN EXPLAINING THAT THE SPEED OF LIGHT APPEARS THE SAME TO ALL OBSERVERS AS SHOWN BY THE MICHELSONMORLEY EXPERIMENT AND IN DESCRIBING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THINGS MOVE AT SPEEDS CLOSE TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT HOWEVER IT WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE NEWTONIAN THEORY OF GRAVITY WHICH SAID THAT OBJECTS ATTRACTED EACH OTHER WITH A FORCE THAT DEPENDED ON THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM THIS MEANT THAT IF ONE MOVED ONE OF THE OBJECTS THE FORCE ON THE OTHER ONE WOULD CHANGE INSTANTANEOUSLY OR IN OTHER GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS SHOULD TRAVEL WITH INFINITE VELOCITY INSTEAD OF AT OR BELOW THE SPEED OF LIGHT AS THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY REQUIRED EINSTEIN MADE A NUMBER OF UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS BETWEEN AND TO FIND A THEORY OF GRAVITY THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH SPECIAL RELATIVITY FINALLY IN HE PROPOSED WHAT WE NOW CALL THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY EINSTEIN MADE THE REVOLUTIONARY SUGGESTION THAT GRAVITY IS NOT A FORCE LIKE OTHER FORCES BUT IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACT THAT SPACETIME IS NOT FLAT AS HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSUMED IT IS CURVED OR WARPED BY THE DISTRIBUTION OF MASS AND ENERGY IN IT BODIES LIKE THE EARTH ARE NOT MADE TO MOVE ON CURVED ORBITS BY A FORCE CALLED GRAVITY INSTEAD THEY FOLLOW THE NEAREST THING TO A STRAIGHT PATH IN A CURVED SPACE WHICH IS CALLED A GEODESIC A GEODESIC IS THE SHORTEST OR LONGEST PATH BETWEEN TWO NEARBY POINTS FOR EXAMPLE THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IS A TWODIMENSIONAL CURVED SPACE A GEODESIC ON THE EARTH IS CALLED A GREAT CIRCLE AND IS THE SHORTEST ROUTE BETWEEN TWO POINTS FIG AS THE GEODESIC IS THE SHORTEST PATH BETWEEN ANY TWO AIRPORTS THIS IS THE ROUTE AN AIRLINE NAVIGATOR WILL TELL THE PILOT TO FLY ALONG IN GENERAL RELATIVITY BODIES ALWAYS FOLLOW STRAIGHT LINES IN FOURDIMENSIONAL SPACETIME BUT THEY NEVERTHELESS APPEAR TO US TO MOVE ALONG CURVED PATHS IN OUR THREEDIMENSIONAL SPACE THIS IS RATHER LIKE WATCHING AN AIRPLANE FLYING OVER HILLY GROUND ALTHOUGH IT FOLLOWS A STRAIGHT LINE IN THREEDIMENSIONAL SPACE ITS SHADOW FOLLOWS A CURVED PATH ON THE TWODIMENSIONAL GROUND THE MASS OF THE SUN CURVES SPACETIME IN SUCH A WAY THAT ALTHOUGH THE EARTH FOLLOWS A STRAIGHT PATH IN FOURDIMENSIONAL SPACETIME IT APPEARS TO US TO MOVE ALONG A CIRCULAR ORBIT IN THREEDIMENSIONAL SPACE FACT THE ORBITS OF THE PLANETS PREDICTED BY GENERAL RELATIVITY ARE ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME AS THOSE PREDICTED BY THE NEWTONIAN THEORY OF GRAVITY HOWEVER IN THE CASE OF MERCURY WHICH BEING THE NEAREST PLANET TO THE SUN FEELS THE STRONGEST GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS AND HAS A RATHER ELONGATED ORBIT GENERAL RELATIVITY PREDICTS THAT THE LONG AXIS OF THE ELLIPSE SHOULD ROTATE ABOUT THE SUN AT A RATE OF ABOUT ONE DEGREE IN TEN THOUSAND YEARS SMALL THOUGH THIS EFFECT IS IT HAD BEEN NOTICED BEFORE AND SERVED AS ONE OF THE FIRST CONFIRMATIONS OF EINSTEINS THEORY IN RECENT YEARS THE EVEN SMALLER DEVIATIONS OF THE ORBITS OF THE OTHER PLANETS FROM THE NEWTONIAN PREDICTIONS HAVE BEEN MEASURED BY RADAR AND FOUND TO AGREE WITH THE PREDICTIONS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY LIGHT RAYS TOO MUST FOLLOW GEODESICS IN SPACETIME AGAIN THE FACT THAT SPACE IS CURVED MEANS THAT LIGHT NO LONGER APPEARS TO TRAVEL IN STRAIGHT LINES IN SPACE SO GENERAL RELATIVITY PREDICTS THAT LIGHT SHOULD BE BENT BY GRAVITATIONAL FIELDS FOR EXAMPLE THE THEORY PREDICTS THAT THE LIGHT CONES OF POINTS NEAR THE SUN WOULD BE SLIGHTLY BENT INWARD ON ACCOUNT OF THE MASS OF THE SUN THIS MEANS THAT LIGHT FROM A DISTANT STAR THAT HAPPENED TO PASS NEAR THE SUN WOULD BE DEFLECTED THROUGH A SMALL ANGLE CAUSING THE STAR TO APPEAR IN A DIFFERENT POSITION TO AN OBSERVER ON THE EARTH FIG OF COURSE IF THE LIGHT FROM THE STAR ALWAYS PASSED CLOSE TO THE SUN WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TELL WHETHER THE LIGHT WAS BEING DEFLECTED OR IF INSTEAD THE STAR WAS REALLY WHERE WE SEE IT HOWEVER AS THE EARTH ORBITS AROUND THE SUN DIFFERENT STARS APPEAR TO PASS BEHIND THE SUN AND HAVE THEIR LIGHT DEFLECTED THEY THEREFORE CHANGE THEIR APPARENT POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER STARS IT IS NORMALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THIS EFFECT BECAUSE THE LIGHT FROM THE SUN MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO OBSERVE STARS THAT APPEAR NEAR TO THE SUN THE SKY HOWEVER IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO SO DURING AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN WHEN THE SUNS LIGHT IS BLOCKED OUT BY THE MOON EINSTEINS PREDICTION OF LIGHT DEFLECTION COULD NOT BE TESTED IMMEDIATELY IN BECAUSE THE FIRST WORLD WAR WAS IN PROGRESS AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THAT A BRITISH EXPEDITION OBSERVING AN ECLIPSE FROM WEST AFRICA SHOWED THAT LIGHT WAS INDEED DEFLECTED BY THE SUN JUST AS PREDICTED BY THE THEORY THIS PROOF OF A GERMAN THEORY BY BRITISH SCIENTISTS WAS HAILED AS A GREAT ACT OF RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AFTER THE WAR IT IS IONIC THEREFORE THAT LATER EXAMINATION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN ON THAT EXPEDITION SHOWED THE ERRORS WERE AS GREAT AS THE EFFECT THEY WERE TRYING TO MEASURE THEIR MEASUREMENT HAD BEEN SHEER LUCK OR A CASE OF KNOWING THE RESULT THEY WANTED TO GET NOT AN UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE IN SCIENCE THE LIGHT DEFLECTION HAS HOWEVER BEEN ACCURATELY CONFIRMED BY A NUMBER OF LATER OBSERVATIONS ANOTHER PREDICTION OF GENERAL RELATIVITY IS THAT TIME SHOULD APPEAR TO SLOWER NEAR A MASSIVE BODY LIKE THE EARTH THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS A RELATION BETWEEN THE ENERGY OF LIGHT AND ITS FREQUENCY THAT IS THE NUMBER OF WAVES OF LIGHT PER SECOND THE GREATER THE ENERGY THE HIGHER FREQUENCY AS LIGHT TRAVELS UPWARD IN THE EARTHS GRAVITATIONAL FIELD IT LOSES ENERGY AND SO ITS FREQUENCY GOES DOWN THIS MEANS THAT THE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN ONE WAVE CREST AND THE NEXT GOES UP TO SOMEONE HIGH UP IT WOULD APPEAR THAT EVERYTHING DOWN BELOW WAS MAKING LONGER TO HAPPEN THIS PREDICTION WAS TESTED IN USING A PAIR OF VERY ACCURATE CLOCKS MOUNTED AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF A WATER TOWER THE CLOCK AT THE BOTTOM WHICH WAS NEARER THE EARTH WAS FOUND TO RUN SLOWER IN EXACT AGREEMENT WITH GENERAL RELATIVITY THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SPEED OF CLOCKS AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS ABOVE THE EARTH IS NOW OF CONSIDERABLE PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE WITH THE ADVENT OF VERY ACCURATE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS BASED ON SIGNALS FROM SATELLITES IF ONE IGNORED THE PREDICTIONS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY THE POSITION THAT ONE CALCULATED WOULD BE WRONG BY SEVERAL MILES NEWTONS LAWS OF MOTION PUT AN END TO THE IDEA OF ABSOLUTE POSITION IN SPACE THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY GETS RID OF ABSOLUTE TIME CONSIDER A PAIR OF TWINS SUPPOSE THAT ONE TWIN GOES TO LIVE ON THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN WHILE THE OTHER STAYS AT SEA LEVEL THE FIRST TWIN WOULD AGE FASTER THAN THE SECOND THUS IF THEY MET AGAIN ONE WOULD BE OLDER THAN THE OTHER IN THIS CASE THE DIFFERENCE IN AGES WOULD BE VERY SMALL BUT IT WOULD BE MUCH LARGER IF ONE OF THE TWINS WENT FOR A LONG TRIP IN A SPACESHIP AT NEARLY THE SPEED OF LIGHT WHEN HE RETURNED HE WOULD BE MUCH YOUNGER THAN THE ONE WHO STAYED ON EARTH THIS IS KNOWN AS THE TWINS PARADOX BUT IT IS A PARADOX ONLY IF ONE HAS THE IDEA OF ABSOLUTE TIME AT THE BACK OF ONES MIND IN THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY THERE IS NO UNIQUE ABSOLUTE TIME BUT INSTEAD EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS HIS OWN PERSONAL MEASURE OF TIME THAT DEPENDS ON WHERE HE IS AND HOW HE IS MOVING BEFORE SPACE AND TIME WERE THOUGHT OF AS A FIXED ARENA IN WHICH EVENTS TOOK PLACE BUT WHICH WAS NOT AFFECTED BY WHAT HAPPENED IN IT THIS WAS TRUE EVEN OF THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY BODIES MOVED FORCES ATTRACTED AND REPELLED BUT TIME AND SPACE SIMPLY CONTINUED UNAFFECTED IT WAS NATURAL TO THINK THAT SPACE AND TIME WENT ON FOREVER THE SITUATION HOWEVER IS QUITE DIFFERENT IN THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY SPACE AND TIME ARE NOW DYNAMIC QUANTITIES WHEN A BODY MOVES OR A FORCE ACTS IT AFFECTS THE CURVATURE OF SPACE AND TIME AND IN TURN THE STRUCTURE OF SPACETIME AFFECTS THE WAY IN WHICH BODIES MOVE AND FORCES ACT SPACE AND TIME NOT ONLY AFFECT BUT ALSO ARE AFFECTED BY EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE UNIVERSE JUST AS ONE CANNOT TALK ABOUT EVENTS IN THE UNIVERSE WITHOUT THE NOTIONS OF SPACE AND TIME SO IN GENERAL RELATIVITY IT BECAME MEANINGLESS TO TALK ABOUT SPACE AND TIME OUTSIDE THE LIMITS OF THE UNIVERSE IN THE FOLLOWING DECADES THIS NEW UNDERSTANDING OF SPACE AND TIME WAS TO REVOLUTIONIZE OUR VIEW OF THE UNIVERSE THE OLD IDEA OF AN ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGING UNIVERSE THAT COULD HAVE EXISTED AND COULD CONTINUE TO EXIST FOREVER WAS REPLACED BY THE NOTION OF A DYNAMIC EXPANDING UNIVERSE THAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEGUN A FINITE TIME AGO AND THAT MIGHT END AT A FINITE TIME IN THE FUTURE THAT REVOLUTION FORMS THE SUBJECT OF THE NEXT CHAPTER AND YEARS LATER IT WAS ALSO TO BE THE STARTING POINT FOR MY WORK IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS ROGER PENROSE AND I SHOWED THAT EINSTEINS GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY IMPLIED THAT THE UNIVERSE MUST HAVE A BEGINNING AND POSSIBLY AN END IF ONE LOOKS AT THE SKY ON A CLEAR MOONLESS NIGHT THE BRIGHTEST OBJECTS ONE SEES ARE LIKELY TO BE THE PLANETS VENUS MARS JUPITER AND SATURN THERE WILL ALSO BE A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF STARS WHICH ARE JUST LIKE OUR OWN SUN BUT MUCH FARTHER FROM US SOME OF THESE FIXED STARS DO IN FACT APPEAR TO CHANGE VERY SLIGHTLY THEIR POSITIONS RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER AS EARTH ORBITS AROUND THE SUN THEY ARE NOT REALLY FIXED AT ALL THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPARATIVELY NEAR TO US AS THE EARTH GOES ROUND THE SUN WE SEE THEM FROM DIFFERENT POSITIONS AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF MORE DISTANT STARS THIS IS FORTUNATE BECAUSE IT ENABLES US TO MEASURE DIRECTLY THE DISTANCE OF THESE STARS FROM US THE NEARER THEY ARE THE MORE THEY APPEAR TO MOVE THE NEAREST STAR CALLED PROXIMA CENTAURI IS FOUND TO BE ABOUT FOUR LIGHTYEARS AWAY THE LIGHT FROM IT TAKES ABOUT FOUR YEARS TO REACH EARTH OR ABOUT TWENTYTHREE MILLION MILLION MILES MOST OF THE OTHER STARS THAT ARE VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE LIE WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED LIGHTYEARS OF US OUR SUN FOR COMPARISON IS A MERE LIGHTMINUTES AWAY THE VISIBLE STARS APPEAR SPREAD ALL OVER THE NIGHT SKY BUT ARE PARTICULARLY CONCENTRATED IN ONE BAND WHICH WE CALL THE MILKY WAY AS LONG AGO AS SOME ASTRONOMERS WERE SUGGESTING THAT THE APPEARANCE OF THE MILKY WAY COULD BE EXPLAINED IF MOST OF THE VISIBLE STARS LIE IN A SINGLE DISKLIKE CONFIGURATION ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE NOW CALL A SPIRAL GALAXY ONLY A FEW DECADES LATER THE ASTRONOMER SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL CONFIRMED THIS IDEA BY PAINSTAKINGLY CATALOGING THE POSITIONS AND DISTANCES OF VAST NUMBERS OF STARS EVEN SO THE IDEA GAINED COMPLETE ACCEPTANCE ONLY EARLY THIS CENTURY OUR MODERN PICTURE OF THE UNIVERSE DATES BACK TO ONLY WHEN THE AMERICAN ASTRONOMER EDWIN HUBBLE DEMONSTRATED THAT OURS WAS NOT THE ONLY GALAXY THERE WERE IN FACT MANY OTHERS WITH VAST TRACTS OF EMPTY SPACE BETWEEN THEM IN ORDER TO PROVE THIS HE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE DISTANCES TO THESE OTHER GALAXIES WHICH ARE SO FAR AWAY THAT UNLIKE NEARBY STARS THEY REALLY DO APPEAR FIXED HUBBLE WAS FORCED THEREFORE TO USE INDIRECT METHODS TO MEASURE THE DISTANCES NOW THE APPARENT BRIGHTNESS OF A STAR DEPENDS ON TWO FACTORS HOW MUCH LIGHT IT RADIATES ITS LUMINOSITY AND HOW FAR IT IS FROM US FOR NEARBY STARS WE CAN MEASURE THEIR APPARENT BRIGHTNESS AND THEIR DISTANCE AND SO WE CAN WORK OUT THEIR LUMINOSITY CONVERSELY IF WE KNEW THE LUMINOSITY OF STARS IN OTHER GALAXIES WE COULD WORK OUT THEIR DISTANCE BY MEASURING THEIR APPARENT BRIGHTNESS HUBBLE NOTED THAT CERTAIN TYPES OF STARS ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME LUMINOSITY WHEN THEY ARE NEAR ENOUGH FOR US TO MEASURE THEREFORE HE ARGUED IF WE FOUND SUCH STARS IN ANOTHER GALAXY WE COULD ASSUME THAT THEY HAD THE SAME LUMINOSITY AND SO CALCULATE THE DISTANCE TO THAT GALAXY IF WE COULD DO THIS FOR A NUMBER OF STARS IN THE SAME GALAXY AND OUR CALCULATIONS ALWAYS GAVE THE SAME DISTANCE WE COULD BE FAIRLY CONFIDENT OF OUR ESTIMATE IN THIS WAY EDWIN HUBBLE WORKED OUT THE DISTANCES TO NINE DIFFERENT GALAXIES WE NOW KNOW THAT OUR GALAXY IS ONLY ONE OF SOME HUNDRED THOUSAND MILLION THAT CAN BE SEEN USING MODERN TELESCOPES EACH GALAXY ITSELF CONTAINING SOME HUNDRED THOUSAND MILLION STARS FIGURE SHOWS A PICTURE OF ONE SPIRAL GALAXY THAT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE THINK OURS MUST LOOK LIKE TO SOMEONE LIVING IN ANOTHER GALAXY WE LIVE IN A GALAXY THAT IS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND LIGHTYEARS ACROSS AND IS SLOWLY ROTATING THE STARS IN ITS SPIRAL ARMS ORBIT AROUND ITS CENTER ABOUT ONCE EVERY SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION YEARS OUR SUN IS JUST AN ORDINARY AVERAGESIZED YELLOW STAR NEAR THE INNER EDGE OF ONE OF THE SPIRAL ARMS WE HAVE CERTAINLY COME A LONG WAY SINCE ARISTOTLE AND PTOLEMY WHEN THOUGHT THAT THE EARTH WAS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE STARS ARE SO FAR AWAY THAT THEY APPEAR TO US TO BE JUST PINPOINTS OF LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE THEIR SIZE OR SHAPE SO HOW CAN WE TELL DIFFERENT TYPES OF STARS APART FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF STARS THERE IS ONLY ONE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE THAT WE CAN OBSERVE THE COLOR OF THEIR LIGHT NEWTON DISCOVERED THAT IF LIGHT FROM THE SUN PASSES THROUGH A TRIANGULARSHAPED PIECE OF GLASS CALLED A PRISM IT BREAKS UP INTO ITS COMPONENT COLORS ITS SPECTRUM AS IN A RAINBOW BY FOCUSING A TELESCOPE ON AN INDIVIDUAL STAR OR GALAXY ONE CAN SIMILARLY OBSERVE THE SPECTRUM OF THE LIGHT FROM THAT STAR OR GALAXY DIFFERENT STARS HAVE DIFFERENT SPECTRA BUT THE RELATIVE BRIGHTNESS OF THE DIFFERENT COLORS IS ALWAYS EXACTLY WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT TO FIND IN THE LIGHT EMITTED BY AN OBJECT THAT IS GLOWING RED HOT IN FACT THE LIGHT EMITTED BY ANY OPAQUE OBJECT THAT IS GLOWING RED HOT HAS A CHARACTERISTIC SPECTRUM THAT DEPENDS ONLY ON ITS TEMPERATURE A THERMAL SPECTRUM THIS MEANS THAT WE CAN TELL A STARS TEMPERATURE FROM THE SPECTRUM OF ITS LIGHT MOREOVER WE FIND THAT CERTAIN VERY SPECIFIC COLORS ARE MISSING FROM STARS SPECTRA AND THESE MISSING COLORS MAY VARY FROM STAR TO STAR SINCE WE KNOW THAT EACH CHEMICAL ELEMENT ABSORBS A CHARACTERISTIC SET OF VERY SPECIFIC COLORS BY MATCHING THESE TO THOSE THAT ARE MISSING FROM A STARS SPECTRUM WE CAN DETERMINE EXACTLY WHICH ELEMENTS ARE PRESENT IN THE STARS ATMOSPHERE IN THE S WHEN ASTRONOMERS BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE SPECTRA OF STARS IN OTHER GALAXIES THEY FOUND SOMETHING MOST PECULIAR THERE WERE THE SAME CHARACTERISTIC SETS OF MISSING COLORS AS FOR STARS IN OUR OWN GALAXY BUT THEY WERE ALL SHIFTED BY THE SAME RELATIVE AMOUNT TOWARD THE RED END OF THE SPECTRUM TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WE MUST FIRST UNDERSTAND THE DOPPLER EFFECT AS WE HAVE SEEN VISIBLE LIGHT CONSISTS OF FLUCTUATIONS OR WAVES IN THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD THE WAVELENGTH OR DISTANCE FROM ONE WAVE CREST TO THE NEXT OF LIGHT IS EXTREMELY SMALL RANGING FROM FOUR TO SEVEN TENMILLIONTHS OF A METER THE DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT ARE WHAT THE HUMAN EYE SEES AS DIFFERENT COLORS WITH THE LONGEST WAVELENGTHS APPEARING AT THE RED END OF THE SPECTRUM AND THE SHORTEST WAVELENGTHS AT THE BLUE END NOW IMAGINE A SOURCE OF LIGHT AT A CONSTANT DISTANCE FROM US SUCH AS A STAR EMITTING WAVES OF LIGHT AT A CONSTANT WAVELENGTH OBVIOUSLY THE WAVELENGTH OF THE WAVES WE RECEIVE WILL BE THE SAME AS THE WAVELENGTH AT WHICH THEY ARE EMITTED THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD OF THE GALAXY WILL NOT BE LARGE ENOUGH TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT SUPPOSE NOW THAT THE SOURCE STARTS MOVING TOWARD US WHEN THE SOURCE EMITS THE NEXT WAVE CREST IT WILL BE NEARER TO US SO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN WAVE CRESTS WILL BE SMALLER THAN WHEN THE STAR WAS STATIONARY THIS MEANS THAT THE WAVELENGTH OF THE WAVES WE RECEIVE IS SHORTER THAN WHEN THE STAR WAS STATIONARY CORRESPONDINGLY IF THE SOURCE IS MOVING AWAY FROM US THE WAVELENGTH OF THE WAVES WE RECEIVE WILL BE LONGER IN THE CASE OF LIGHT THEREFORE MEANS THAT STARS MOVING AWAY FROM US WILL HAVE THEIR SPECTRA SHIFTED TOWARD THE RED END OF THE SPECTRUM REDSHIFTED AND THOSE MOVING TOWARD US WILL HAVE THEIR SPECTRA BLUESHIFTED THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WAVELENGTH AND SPEED WHICH IS CALLED THE DOPPLER EFFECT IS AN EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE LISTEN TO A CAR PASSING ON THE ROAD AS THE CAR IS APPROACHING ITS ENGINE SOUNDS AT A HIGHER PITCH CORRESPONDING TO A SHORTER WAVELENGTH AND HIGHER FREQUENCY OF SOUND WAVES AND WHEN IT PASSES AND GOES AWAY IT SOUNDS AT A LOWER PITCH THE BEHAVIOR OF LIGHT OR RADIO WAVES IS SIMILAR INDEED THE POLICE MAKE USE OF THE DOPPLER EFFECT TO MEASURE THE SPEED OF CARS BY MEASURING THE WAVELENGTH OF PULSES OF RADIO WAVES REFLECTED OFF THEM LN THE YEARS FOLLOWING HIS PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF OTHER GALAXIES RUBBLE SPENT HIS TIME CATALOGING THEIR DISTANCES AND OBSERVING THEIR SPECTRA AT THAT TIME MOST PEOPLE EXPECTED THE GALAXIES TO BE MOVING AROUND QUITE RANDOMLY AND SO EXPECTED TO FIND AS MANY BLUESHIFTED SPECTRA AS REDSHIFTED ONES IT WAS QUITE A SURPRISE THEREFORE TO FIND THAT MOST GALAXIES APPEARED REDSHIFTED NEARLY ALL WERE MOVING AWAY FROM US MORE SURPRISING STILL WAS THE FINDING THAT HUBBLE PUBLISHED IN EVEN THE SIZE OF A GALAXYS RED SHIFT IS NOT RANDOM BUT IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE GALAXYS DISTANCE FROM US OR IN OTHER WORDS THE FARTHER A GALAXY IS THE FASTER IT IS MOVING AWAY AND THAT MEANT THAT THE UNIVERSE COULD NOT BE STATIC AS EVERYONE PREVIOUSLY HAD THOUGHT IS IN FACT EXPANDING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT GALAXIES IS CHANGING ALL THE TIME THE DISCOVERY THAT THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING WAS ONE OF THE GREAT INTELLECTUAL REVOLUTIONS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH HINDSIGHT IT IS EASY WONDER WHY NO ONE HAD THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE NEWTON AND OTHERS SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT A STATIC UNIVERSE WOULD SOON START TO CONTRACT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GRAVITY BUT SUPPOSE INSTEAD THAT THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING IF IT WAS EXPANDING FAIRLY SLOWLY THE FORCE OF GRAVITY WOULD CAUSE IT EVENTUALLY TO STOP EXPANDING AND THEN TO START CONTRACTING HOWEVER IF IT WAS EXPANDING AT MORE THAN A CERTAIN CRITICAL RATE GRAVITY WOULD NEVER BE STRONG ENOUGH TO STOP IT AND THE UNIVERSE WOULD CONTINUE TO EXPAND FOREVER THIS IS A BIT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE FIRES A ROCKET UPWARD FROM THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IF IT HAS A FAIRLY LOW SPEED GRAVITY WILL EVENTUALLY STOP THE ROCKET AND IT WILL START FALLING BACK ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE ROCKET HAS MORE THAN A CERTAIN CRITICAL SPEED ABOUT SEVEN MILES PER SECOND GRAVITY WILL NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL IT BACK SO IT WILL KEEP GOING AWAY FROM THE EARTH FOREVER THIS BEHAVIOR OF THE UNIVERSE COULD HAVE BEEN PREDICTED FROM NEWTONS THEORY OF GRAVITY AT ANY TIME IN THE NINETEENTH THE EIGHTEENTH OR EVEN THE LATE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY YET SO STRONG WAS THE BELIEF IN A STATIC UNIVERSE THAT IT PERSISTED INTO THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY EVEN EINSTEIN WHEN HE FORMULATED THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY IN WAS SO SURE THAT THE UNIVERSE HAD TO BE STATIC THAT HE MODIFIED HIS THEORY TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE INTRODUCING A SOCALLED COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT INTO HIS EQUATIONS EINSTEIN INTRODUCED A NEW ANTIGRAVITY FORCE WHICH UNLIKE OTHER FORCES DID NOT COME FROM ANY PARTICULAR SOURCE BUT WAS BUILT INTO THE VERY FABRIC OF SPACETIME HE CLAIMED THAT SPACETIME HAD AN INBUILT TENDENCY TO EXPAND AND THIS COULD BE MADE TO BALANCE EXACTLY THE ATTRACTION OF ALL THE MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE SO THAT A STATIC UNIVERSE WOULD RESULT ONLY ONE MAN IT SEEMS WAS WILLING TO TAKE GENERAL RELATIVITY AT FACE VALUE AND WHILE EINSTEIN AND OTHER PHYSICISTS WERE LOOKING FOR WAYS OF AVOIDING GENERAL RELATIVITYS PREDICTION OF A NONSTATIC UNIVERSE THE RUSSIAN PHYSICIST AND MATHEMATICIAN ALEXANDER FRIEDMANN INSTEAD SET ABOUT EXPLAINING IT FRIEDMANN MADE TWO VERY SIMPLE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE UNIVERSE THAT THE UNIVERSE LOOKS IDENTICAL IN WHICHEVER DIRECTION WE LOOK AND THAT THIS WOULD ALSO BE TRUE IF WE WERE OBSERVING THE UNIVERSE FROM ANYWHERE ELSE FROM THESE TWO IDEAS ALONE FRIEDMANN SHOWED THAT WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT THE UNIVERSE TO BE STATIC IN FACT IN SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE EDWIN HUBBLES DISCOVERY FRIEDMANN PREDICTED EXACTLY WHAT HUBBLE FOUND THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE UNIVERSE LOOKS THE SAME IN EVERY DIRECTION IS CLEARLY NOT TRUE IN REALITY FOR EXAMPLE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE OTHER STARS IN OUR GALAXY FORM A DISTINCT BAND OF LIGHT ACROSS THE NIGHT SKY CALLED THE MILKY WAY BUT IF WE LOOK AT DISTANT GALAXIES THERE SEEMS TO BE MORE OR LESS THE SAME NUMBER OF THEM SO THE UNIVERSE DOES SEEM TO BE ROUGHLY THE SAME IN EVERY DIRECTION PROVIDED ONE VIEWS IT ON A LARGE SCALE COMPARED TO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN GALAXIES AND IGNORES THE DIFFERENCES ON SMALL SCALES FOR A LONG TIME THIS WAS SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION FOR FRIEDMANNS ASSUMPTION AS A ROUGH APPROXIMATION TO THE REAL UNIVERSE BUT MORE RECENTLY A LUCKY ACCIDENT UNCOVERED THE FACT THAT FRIEDMANNS ASSUMPTION IS IN FACT A REMARKABLY ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF OUR UNIVERSE IN TWO AMERICAN PHYSICISTS AT THE BELL TELEPHONE LABORATORIES IN NEW JERSEY ARNO PENZIAS AND ROBERT WILSON WERE TESTING A VERY SENSITIVE MICROWAVE DETECTOR MICROWAVES ARE JUST LIKE LIGHT WAVES BUT WITH A WAVELENGTH OF AROUND A CENTIMETER PENZIAS AND WILSON WERE WORRIED WHEN THEY FOUND THAT THEIR DETECTOR WAS PICKING UP MORE NOISE THAN IT OUGHT TO THE NOISE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE COMING FROM ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION FIRST THEY DISCOVERED BIRD DROPPINGS IN THEIR DETECTOR AND CHECKED FOR OTHER POSSIBLE MALFUNCTIONS BUT SOON RULED THESE OUT THEY KNEW THAT ANY NOISE FROM WITHIN THE ATMOSPHERE WOULD BE STRONGER WHEN THE DETECTOR WAS NOT POINTING STRAIGHT UP THAN WHEN IT WAS BECAUSE LIGHT RAYS TRAVEL THROUGH MUCH MORE ATMOSPHERE WHEN RECEIVED FROM NEAR THE HORIZON THAN WHEN RECEIVED FROM DIRECTLY OVERHEAD THE EXTRA NOISE WAS THE SAME WHICHEVER DIRECTION THE DETECTOR WAS POINTED SO IT MUST COME FROM OUTSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE IT WAS ALSO THE SAME DAY AND NIGHT AND THROUGHOUT THE YEAR EVEN THOUGH THE EARTH WAS ROTATING ON ITS AXIS AND ORBITING AROUND THE SUN THIS SHOWED THAT THE RADIATION MUST COME FROM BEYOND THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND EVEN FROM BEYOND THE GALAXY AS OTHERWISE IT WOULD VARY AS THE MOVEMENT OF EARTH POINTED THE DETECTOR IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS IN FACT WE KNOW THAT THE RADIATION MUST HAVE TRAVELED TO US ACROSS MOST OF THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE AND SINCE IT APPEARS TO BE THE SAME IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THE UNIVERSE MUST ALSO BE THE SAME IN EVERY DIRECTION IF ONLY ON A LARGE SCALE WE NOW KNOW THAT WHICHEVER DIRECTION WE LOOK THIS NOISE NEVER VARIES BY MORE THAN A TINY FRACTION SO PENZIAS AND WILSON HAD UNWITTINGLY STUMBLED ACROSS A REMARKABLY ACCURATE CONFIRMATION OF FRIEDMANNS FIRST ASSUMPTION HOWEVER BECAUSE THE UNIVERSE IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT ONLY ON AVERAGE ON A LARGE SCALE THE MICROWAVES CANNOT BE EXACTLY THE SAME IN EVERY DIRECTION EITHER THERE HAVE TO BE SLIGHT VARIATIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THESE WERE FIRST DETECTED IN BY THE COSMIC BACKGROUND EXPLORER SATELLITE OR COBE AT A LEVEL OF ABOUT ONE PART IN A HUNDRED THOUSAND SMALL THOUGH THESE VARIATIONS ARE THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT AS WILL BE EXPLAINED IN CHAPTER  AT ROUGHLY THE SAME TIME AS PENZIAS AND WILSON WERE INVESTIGATING NOISE IN THEIR DETECTOR TWO AMERICAN PHYSICISTS AT NEARBY PRINCETON UNIVERSITY BOB DICKE AND JIM PEEBLES WERE ALSO TAKING AN INTEREST IN MICROWAVES THEY WERE WORKING ON A SUGGESTION MADE BY GEORGE GAMOW ONCE A STUDENT OF ALEXANDER FRIEDMANN THAT THE EARLY UNIVERSE SHOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HOT AND DENSE GLOWING WHITE HOT DICKE AND PEEBLES ARGUED THAT WE SHOULD STILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE GLOW OF THE EARLY UNIVERSE BECAUSE LIGHT FROM VERY DISTANT PARTS OF IT WOULD ONLY JUST BE REACHING US NOW HOWEVER THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE MEANT THAT THIS LIGHT SHOULD BE SO GREATLY REDSHIFTED THAT IT WOULD APPEAR TO US NOW AS MICROWAVE RADIATION DICKE AND PEEBLES WERE PREPARING TO LOOK FOR THIS RADIATION WHEN PENZIAS AND WILSON HEARD ABOUT THEIR WORK AND REALIZED THAT THEY HAD ALREADY FOUND IT FOR THIS PENZIAS AND WILSON WERE AWARDED THE NOBEL PRIZE IN WHICH SEEMS A BIT HARD ON DICKE AND PEEBLES NOT TO MENTION GAMOW NOW AT FIRST SIGHT ALL THIS EVIDENCE THAT THE UNIVERSE LOOKS THE SAME WHICHEVER DIRECTION WE LOOK IN MIGHT SEEM TO SUGGEST THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT OUR PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE IN PARTICULAR IT MIGHT SEEM THAT IF WE OBSERVE ALL OTHER GALAXIES TO BE MOVING AWAY FROM US THEN WE MUST BE AT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE THERE IS HOWEVER AN ALTERNATE EXPLANATION THE UNIVERSE MIGHT LOOK THE SAME IN EVERY DIRECTION AS SEEN FROM ANY OTHER GALAXY TOO THIS AS WE HAVE SEEN WAS FRIEDMANNS SECOND ASSUMPTION WE HAVE NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR OR AGAINST THIS ASSUMPTION WE BELIEVE IT ONLY ON GROUNDS OF MODESTY IT WOULD BE MOST REMARKABLE IF THE UNIVERSE LOOKED THE SAME IN EVERY DIRECTION AROUND US BUT NOT AROUND OTHER POINTS IN THE UNIVERSE IN FRIEDMANNS MODEL ALL THE GALAXIES ARE MOVING DIRECTLY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER THE SITUATION IS RATHER LIKE A BALLOON WITH A NUMBER OF SPOTS PAINTED ON IT BEING STEADILY BLOWN UP AS THE BALLOON EXPANDS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN ANY TWO SPOTS INCREASES BUT THERE IS NO SPOT THAT CAN BE SAID TO BE THE CENTER OF THE EXPANSION MOREOVER THE FARTHER APART THE SPOTS ARE THE FASTER THEY WILL BE MOVING APART SIMILARLY IN FRIEDMANNS MODEL THE SPEED AT WHICH ANY TWO GALAXIES ARE MOVING APART IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM SO IT PREDICTED THAT THE RED SHIFT OF A GALAXY SHOULD BE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO ITS DISTANCE FROM US EXACTLY AS HUBBLE FOUND DESPITE THE SUCCESS OF HIS MODEL AND HIS PREDICTION OF HUBBLES OBSERVATIONS FRIEDMANNS WORK REMAINED LARGELY UNKNOWN IN THE WEST UNTIL SIMILAR MODELS WERE DISCOVERED IN BY THE AMERICAN PHYSICIST HOWARD ROBERTSON AND THE BRITISH MATHEMATICIAN ARTHUR WALKER IN RESPONSE TO HUBBLES DISCOVERY OF THE UNIFORM EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE ALTHOUGH FRIEDMANN FOUND ONLY ONE THERE ARE IN FACT THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MODELS THAT OBEY FRIEDMANNS TWO FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS IN THE FIRST KIND WHICH FRIEDMANN FOUND THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING SUFFICIENTLY SLOWLY THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT GALAXIES CAUSES THE EXPANSION TO SLOW DOWN AND EVENTUALLY TO STOP THE GALAXIES THEN START TO MOVE TOWARD EACH OTHER AND THE UNIVERSE CONTRACTS IN THIS CASE THE SEPARATION SHOWN IN FIGURE ALSO STARTS AT ZERO AND INCREASES FOREVER HOWEVER THE SPEED AT WHICH THE GALAXIES ARE MOVING APART GETS SMALLER AND SMALLER ALTHOUGH IT NEVER QUITE REACHES ZERO A REMARKABLE FEATURE OF THE FIRST KIND OF FRIEDMANN MODEL IS THAT IN IT THE UNIVERSE IS NOT INFINITE IN SPACE BUT NEITHER DOES SPACE HAVE ANY BOUNDARY GRAVITY IS SO STRONG THAT SPACE IS BENT ROUND ONTO ITSELF MAKING IT RATHER LIKE THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IF ONE KEEPS TRAVELING IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH ONE NEVER COMES UP AGAINST AN IMPASSABLE BARRIER OR FALLS OVER THE EDGE BUT EVENTUALLY COMES BACK TO WHERE ONE STARTED IN THE FIRST KIND OF FRIEDMANN MODEL SPACE IS JUST LIKE THIS BUT WITH THREE DIMENSIONS INSTEAD OF TWO FOR THE EARTHS SURFACE THE FOURTH DIMENSION TIME IS ALSO FINITE IN EXTENT BUT IT IS LIKE A LINE WITH TWO ENDS OR BOUNDARIES A BEGINNING AND AN END WE SHALL SEE LATER THAT WHEN ONE COMBINES GENERAL RELATIVITY WITH THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR BOTH SPACE AND TIME TO BE FINITE WITHOUT ANY EDGES OR BOUNDARIES THE IDEA THAT ONE COULD GO RIGHT ROUND THE UNIVERSE AND END UP WHERE ONE STARTED MAKES GOOD SCIENCE FICTION BUT IT DOESNT HAVE MUCH PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE BECAUSE IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT THE UNIVERSE WOULD RECOLLAPSE TO ZERO SIZE BEFORE ONE COULD GET ROUND YOU WOULD NEED TO TRAVEL FASTER THAN LIGHT IN ORDER TO END UP WHERE YOU STARTED BEFORE THE UNIVERSE CAME TO AN END AND THAT IS NOT ALLOWED IN THE FIRST KIND OF FRIEDMANN MODEL WHICH EXPANDS AND RECOLLAPSES SPACE IS BENT IN ON ITSELF LIKE THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IT IS THEREFORE FINITE IN EXTENT IN THE SECOND KIND OF MODEL WHICH EXPANDS FOREVER SPACE IS BENT THE OTHER WAY LIKE THE SURFACE OF A SADDLE SO IN THIS CASE SPACE IS INFINITE FINALLY IN THE THIRD KIND OF FRIEDMANN MODEL WITH JUST THE CRITICAL RATE OF EXPANSION SPACE IS FLAT AND THEREFORE IS ALSO INFINITE BUT WHICH FRIEDMANN MODEL DESCRIBES OUR UNIVERSE WILL THE UNIVERSE EVENTUALLY STOP EXPANDING AND START CONTRACTING OR WILL IT EXPAND FOREVER TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION WE NEED TO KNOW THE PRESENT RATE OF EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE AND ITS PRESENT AVERAGE DENSITY IF THE DENSITY IS LESS THAN A CERTAIN CRITICAL VALUE DETERMINED BY THE RATE OF EXPANSION THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION WILL BE TOO WEAK TO HALT THE EXPANSION IF THE DENSITY IS GREATER THAN THE CRITICAL VALUE GRAVITY WILL STOP THE EXPANSION AT SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE AND CAUSE THE UNIVERSE TO RECOLLAPSE WE CAN DETERMINE THE PRESENT RATE OF EXPANSION BY MEASURING THE VELOCITIES AT WHICH OTHER GALAXIES ARE MOVING AWAY FROM US USING THE DOPPLER EFFECT THIS CAN BE DONE VERY ACCURATELY HOWEVER THE DISTANCES TO THE GALAXIES ARE NOT VERY WELL KNOWN BECAUSE WE CAN ONLY MEASURE THEM INDIRECTLY SO ALL WE KNOW IS THAT THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING BY BETWEEN PERCENT AND PERCENT EVERY THOUSAND MILLION YEARS HOWEVER OUR UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE PRESENT AVERAGE DENSITY OF THE UNIVERSE IS EVEN GREATER IF WE ADD UP THE MASSES OF ALL THE STARS THAT WE CAN SEE IN OUR GALAXY AND OTHER GALAXIES THE TOTAL IS LESS THAN ONE HUNDREDTH OF THE AMOUNT REQUIRED TO HALT THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE EVEN FOR THE LOWEST ESTIMATE OF THE RATE OF EXPANSION OUR GALAXY AND OTHER GALAXIES HOWEVER MUST CONTAIN A LARGE AMOUNT OF DARK MATTER THAT WE CANNOT SEE DIRECTLY BUT WHICH WE KNOW MUST BE THERE BECAUSE OF THE INFLUENCE OF ITS GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION ON THE ORBITS OF STARS IN THE GALAXIES MOREOVER MOST GALAXIES ARE FOUND IN CLUSTERS AND WE CAN SIMILARLY INFER THE PRESENCE OF YET MORE DARK MATTER IN BETWEEN THE GALAXIES IN THESE CLUSTERS BY ITS EFFECT ON THE MOTION OF THE GALAXIES WHEN WE ADD UP ALL THIS DARK MATTER WE STILL GET ONLY ABOUT ONE TENTH OF THE AMOUNT REQUIRED TO HALT THE EXPANSION HOWEVER WE CANNOT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME OTHER FORM OF MATTER DISTRIBUTED ALMOST UNIFORMLY THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE THAT WE HAVE NOT YET DETECTED AND THAT MIGHT STILL RAISE THE AVERAGE DENSITY OF THE UNIVERSE UP TO THE CRITICAL VALUE NEEDED TO HALT THE EXPANSION THE PRESENT EVIDENCE THEREFORE SUGGESTS THAT THE UNIVERSE WILL PROBABLY EXPAND FOREVER BUT ALL WE CAN REALLY BE SURE OF IS THAT EVEN IF THE UNIVERSE IS GOING TO RECOLLAPSE IT WONT DO SO FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER TEN THOUSAND MILLION YEARS SINCE IT HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPANDING FOR AT LEAST THAT LONG THIS SHOULD NOT UNDULY WORRY US BY THAT TIME UNLESS WE HAVE COLONIZED BEYOND THE SOLAR SYSTEM MANKIND WILL LONG SINCE HAVE DIED OUT EXTINGUISHED ALONG WITH OUR SUN ALL OF THE FRIEDMANN SOLUTIONS HAVE THE FEATURE THAT AT SOME TIME IN THE PAST BETWEEN TEN AND TWENTY THOUSAND MILLION YEARS AGO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN NEIGHBORING GALAXIES MUST HAVE BEEN ZERO AT THAT TIME WHICH WE CALL THE BIG BANG THE DENSITY OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE CURVATURE OF SPACETIME WOULD HAVE BEEN INFINITE BECAUSE MATHEMATICS CANNOT REALLY HANDLE INFINITE NUMBERS THIS MEANS THAT THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ON WHICH FRIEDMANNS SOLUTIONS ARE BASED PREDICTS THAT THERE IS A POINT IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE THE THEORY ITSELF BREAKS DOWN SUCH A POINT IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT MATHEMATICIANS CALL A SINGULARITY IN FACT ALL OUR THEORIES OF SCIENCE ARE FORMULATED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT SPACETIME IS SMOOTH AND NEARLY FIAT SO THEY BREAK DOWN AT THE BIG BANG SINGULARITY WHERE THE CURVATURE OF SPACETIME IS INFINITE THIS MEANS THAT EVEN IF THERE WERE EVENTS BEFORE THE BIG BANG ONE COULD NOT USE THEM TO DETERMINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AFTERWARD BECAUSE PREDICTABILITY WOULD BREAK DOWN AT THE BIG BANG CORRESPONDINGLY IF AS IS THE CASE WE KNOW ONLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE BIG BANG WE COULD NOT DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENED BEFOREHAND AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED EVENTS BEFORE THE BIG BANG CAN HAVE NO CONSEQUENCES SO THEY SHOULD NOT FORM PART OF A SCIENTIFIC MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE WE SHOULD THEREFORE CUT THEM OUT OF THE MODEL AND SAY THAT TIME HAD A BEGINNING AT THE BIG BANG MANY PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE THE IDEA THAT TIME HAS A BEGINNING PROBABLY BECAUSE IT SMACKS OF DIVINE INTERVENTION THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ON THE OTHER HAND SEIZED ON THE BIG BANG MODEL AND IN OFFICIALLY PRONOUNCED IT TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BIBLE THERE WERE THEREFORE A NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS TO AVOID THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE HAD BEEN A BIG BANG THE PROPOSAL THAT GAINED WIDEST SUPPORT WAS CALLED THE STEADY STATE THEORY IT WAS SUGGESTED IN BY TWO REFUGEES FROM NAZIOCCUPIED AUSTRIA HERMANN BONDI AND THOMAS GOLD TOGETHER WITH A BRITON FRED HOYLE WHO HAD WORKED WITH THEM ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF RADAR DURING THE WAR THE IDEA WAS THAT AS THE GALAXIES MOVED AWAY FROM EACH OTHER NEW GALAXIES WERE CONTINUALLY FORMING IN THE GAPS IN BETWEEN FROM NEW MATTER THAT WAS BEING CONTINUALLY CREATED THE UNIVERSE WOULD THEREFORE LOOK ROUGHLY THE SAME AT ALL TIMES AS WELL AS AT ALL POINTS OF SPACE THE STEADY STATE THEORY REQUIRED A MODIFICATION OF GENERAL RELATIVITY TO ALLOW FOR THE CONTINUAL CREATION OF MATTER BUT THE RATE THAT WAS INVOLVED WAS SO LOW ABOUT ONE PARTICLE PER CUBIC KILOMETER PER YEAR THAT IT WAS NOT IN CONFLICT WITH EXPERIMENT THE THEORY WAS A GOOD SCIENTIFIC THEORY IN THE SENSE DESCRIBED IN CHAPTER IT WAS SIMPLE AND IT MADE DEFINITE PREDICTIONS THAT COULD BE TESTED BY OBSERVATION ONE OF THESE PREDICTIONS WAS THAT THE NUMBER OF GALAXIES OR SIMILAR OBJECTS IN ANY GIVEN VOLUME OF SPACE SHOULD BE THE SAME WHEREVER AND WHENEVER WE LOOK IN THE UNIVERSE IN THE LATE S AND EARLY  S A SURVEY OF SOURCES OF RADIO WAVES FROM OUTER SPACE WAS CARRIED OUT AT CAMBRIDGE BY A GROUP OF ASTRONOMERS LED BY MARTIN RYLE WHO HAD ALSO WORKED WITH BONDI GOLD AND HOYLE ON RADAR DURING THE WAR THE CAMBRIDGE GROUP SHOWED THAT MOST OF THESE RADIO SOURCES MUST LIE OUTSIDE OUR GALAXY INDEED MANY OF THEM COULD BE IDENTIFIED WITH OTHER GALAXIES AND ALSO THAT THERE WERE MANY MORE WEAK SOURCES THAN STRONG ONES THEY INTERPRETED THE WEAK SOURCES AS BEING THE MORE DISTANT ONES AND THE STRONGER ONES AS BEING NEARER THEN THERE APPEARED TO BE LESS COMMON SOURCES PER UNIT VOLUME OF SPACE FOR THE NEARBY SOURCES THAN FOR THE DISTANT ONES THIS COULD MEAN THAT WE ARE AT THE CENTER OF A GREAT REGION IN THE UNIVERSE IN WHICH THE SOURCES ARE FEWER THAN ELSEWHERE ALTERNATIVELY IT COULD MEAN THAT THE SOURCES WERE MORE NUMEROUS IN THE PAST AT THE TIME THAT THE RADIO WAVES LEFT ON THEIR JOURNEY TO US THAN THEY ARE NOW EITHER EXPLANATION CONTRADICTED THE PREDICTIONS OF THE STEADY STATE THEORY MOREOVER THE DISCOVERY OF THE MICROWAVE RADIATION BY PENZIAS AND WILSON IN ALSO INDICATED THAT THE UNIVERSE MUST HAVE BEEN MUCH DENSER IN THE PAST THE STEADY STATE THEORY THEREFORE HAD TO BE ABANDONED ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO AVOID THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A BIG BANG AND THEREFORE A BEGINNING OF TIME WAS MADE BY TWO RUSSIAN SCIENTISTS EVGENII LIFSHITZ AND ISAAC KHALATNIKOV IN THEY SUGGESTED THAT THE BIG BANG MIGHT BE A PECULIARITY OF FRIEDMANNS MODELS ALONE WHICH AFTER ALL WERE ONLY APPROXIMATIONS TO THE REAL UNIVERSE PERHAPS OF ALL THE MODELS THAT WERE ROUGHLY LIKE THE REAL UNIVERSE ONLY FRIEDMANNS WOULD CONTAIN A BIG BANG SINGULARITY IN FRIEDMANNS MODELS THE GALAXIES ARE ALL MOVING DIRECTLY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER SO IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT AT SOME TIME IN THE PAST THEY WERE ALL AT THE SAME PLACE IN THE REAL UNIVERSE HOWEVER THE GALAXIES ARE NOT JUST MOVING DIRECTLY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER THEY ALSO HAVE SMALL SIDEWAYS VELOCITIES SO IN REALITY THEY NEED NEVER HAVE BEEN ALL AT EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE ONLY VERY CLOSE TOGETHER PERHAPS THEN THE CURRENT EXPANDING UNIVERSE RESULTED NOT FROM A BIG BANG SINGULARITY BUT FROM AN EARLIER CONTRACTING PHASE AS THE UNIVERSE HAD COLLAPSED THE PARTICLES IN IT MIGHT NOT HAVE ALL COLLIDED BUT HAD FLOWN PAST AND THEN AWAY FROM EACH OTHER PRODUCING THE PRESENT EXPANSION OF THE THE UNIVERSE THAT WERE ROUGHLY LIKE FRIEDMANNS MODELS BUT TOOK ACCOUNT OF THE IRREGULARITIES AND RANDOM VELOCITIES OF GALAXIES IN THE REAL UNIVERSE THEY SHOWED THAT SUCH MODELS COULD START WITH A BIG BANG EVEN THOUGH THE GALAXIES WERE NO LONGER ALWAYS MOVING DIRECTLY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER BUT THEY CLAIMED THAT THIS WAS STILL ONLY POSSIBLE IN CERTAIN EXCEPTIONAL MODELS IN WHICH THE GALAXIES WERE ALL MOVING IN JUST THE RIGHT WAY THEY ARGUED THAT SINCE THERE SEEMED TO BE INFINITELY MORE FRIEDMANNLIKE MODELS WITHOUT A BIG BANG SINGULARITY THAN THERE WERE WITH ONE WE SHOULD CONCLUDE THAT THERE HAD NOT IN REALITY BEEN A BIG BANG THEY LATER REALIZED HOWEVER THAT THERE WAS A MUCH MORE GENERAL CLASS OF FRIEDMANNLIKE MODELS THAT DID HAVE SINGULARITIES AND IN WHICH THE GALAXIES DID NOT HAVE TO BE MOVING ANY SPECIAL WAY THEY THEREFORE WITHDREW THEIR CLAIM IN  THE WORK OF LIFSHITZ AND KHALATNIKOV WAS VALUABLE BECAUSE IT SHOWED THAT THE UNIVERSE COULD HAVE HAD A SINGULARITY A BIG BANG IF THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY WAS CORRECT HOWEVER IT DID NOT RESOLVE THE CRUCIAL QUESTION DOES GENERAL RELATIVITY PREDICT THAT OUR UNIVERSE SHOULD HAVE HAD A BIG BANG A BEGINNING OF TIME THE ANSWER TO THIS CARNE OUT OF A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT APPROACH INTRODUCED BY A BRITISH MATHEMATICIAN AND PHYSICIST ROGER PENROSE IN USING THE WAY LIGHT CONES BEHAVE IN GENERAL RELATIVITY TOGETHER WITH THE FACT THAT GRAVITY IS ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE HE SHOWED THAT A STAR COLLAPSING UNDER ITS OWN GRAVITY IS TRAPPED IN A REGION WHOSE SURFACE EVENTUALLY SHRINKS TO ZERO SIZE AND SINCE THE SURFACE OF THE REGION SHRINKS TO ZERO SO TOO MUST ITS VOLUME ALL THE MATTER IN THE STAR WILL BE COMPRESSED INTO A REGION OF ZERO VOLUME SO THE DENSITY OF MATTER AND THE CURVATURE OF SPACETIME BECOME INFINITE IN OTHER WORDS ONE HAS A SINGULARITY CONTAINED WITHIN A REGION OF SPACETIME KNOWN AS A BLACK HOLE AT FIRST SIGHT PENROSES RESULT APPLIED ONLY TO STARS IT DIDNT HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE HAD A BIG BANG SINGULARITY IN ITS PAST HOWEVER AT THE TIME THAT PENROSE PRODUCED HIS THEOREM I WAS A RESEARCH STUDENT DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM WITH WHICH TO COMPLETE MY PHD THESIS TWO YEARS BEFORE I HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED AS SUFFERING FROM ALS COMMONLY KNOWN AS LOU GEHRIGS DISEASE OR MOTOR NEURON DISEASE AND GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT I HAD ONLY ONE OR TWO MORE YEARS TO LIVE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE HAD NOT SEEMED MUCH POINT IN WORKING ON MY PHD I DID NOT EXPECT TO SURVIVE THAT LONG YET TWO YEARS HAD GONE BY AND I WAS NOT THAT MUCH WORSE IN FACT THINGS WERE GOING RATHER WELL FOR ME AND I HAD GOTTEN ENGAGED TO A VERY NICE GIRL JANE WILDE BUT IN ORDER TO GET MARRIED I NEEDED A JOB AND IN ORDER TO GET A JOB I NEEDED A PHD IN I READ ABOUT PENROSES THEOREM THAT ANY BODY UNDERGOING GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE MUST EVENTUALLY FORM A SINGULARITY I SOON REALIZED THAT IF ONE REVERSED THE DIRECTION OF TIME IN PENROSES THEOREM SO THAT THE COLLAPSE BECAME AN EXPANSION THE CONDITIONS OF HIS THEOREM WOULD STILL HOLD PROVIDED THE UNIVERSE WERE ROUGHLY LIKE A FRIEDMANN MODEL ON LARGE SCALES AT THE PRESENT TIME PENROSES THEOREM HAD SHOWN THAT ANY COLLAPSING STAR MUST END IN A SINGULARITY THE TIMEREVERSED ARGUMENT SHOWED THAT ANY FRIEDMANNLIKE EXPANDING UNIVERSE MUST HAVE BEGUN WITH A SINGULARITY FOR TECHNICAL REASONS PENROSES THEOREM REQUIRED THAT THE UNIVERSE BE INFINITE IN SPACE SO I COULD IN FACT USE IT TO PROVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A SINGULARITY ONLY IF THE UNIVERSE WAS EXPANDING FAST ENOUGH TO AVOID COLLAPSING AGAIN SINCE ONLY THOSE FRIEDMANN MODELS WERE INFINITE IN SPACE DURING THE NEXT FEW YEARS I DEVELOPED NEW MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES TO REMOVE THIS AND OTHER TECHNICAL CONDITIONS FROM THE THEOREMS THAT PROVED THAT SINGULARITIES MUST OCCUR THE FINAL RESULT WAS A JOINT PAPER BY PENROSE AND MYSELF IN WHICH AT LAST PROVED THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A BIG BANG SINGULARITY PROVIDED ONLY THAT GENERAL RELATIVITY IS CORRECT AND THE UNIVERSE CONTAINS AS MUCH MATTER AS WE OBSERVE THERE WAS A LOT OF OPPOSITION TO OUR WORK PARTLY FROM THE RUSSIANS BECAUSE OF THEIR MARXIST BELIEF IN SCIENTIFIC DETERMINISM AND PARTLY FROM PEOPLE WHO FELT THAT THE WHOLE IDEA OF SINGULARITIES WAS REPUGNANT AND SPOILED THE BEAUTY OF EINSTEINS THEORY HOWEVER ONE CANNOT REALLY ARGUE WITH A MATHEMATICAL THEOREM SO IN THE END OUR WORK BECAME GENERALLY ACCEPTED AND NOWADAYS NEARLY EVERYONE ASSUMES THAT THE UNIVERSE STARTED WITH A BIG BANG SINGULARITY IT IS PERHAPS IRONIC THAT HAVING CHANGED MY MIND I AM NOW TRYING TO CONVINCE OTHER PHYSICISTS THAT THERE WAS IN FACT NO SINGULARITY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE AS WE SHALL SEE LATER IT CAN DISAPPEAR ONCE QUANTUM EFFECTS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS CHAPTER HOW IN LESS THAN HALF A CENTURY MANS VIEW OF THE UNIVERSE FORMED OVER MILLENNIA HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED HUBBLES DISCOVERY THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS EXPANDING AND THE REALIZATION OF THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF OUR OWN PLANET IN THE VASTNESS OF THE UNIVERSE WERE JUST THE STARTING POINT AS EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL EVIDENCE MOUNTED IT BECAME MORE AND MORE CLEAR THAT THE UNIVERSE MUST HAVE HAD A BEGINNING IN TIME UNTIL IN THIS WAS FINALLY PROVED BY PENROSE AND MYSELF ON THE BASIS OF EINSTEINS GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY THAT PROOF SHOWED THAT GENERAL RELATIVITY IS ONLY AN INCOMPLETE THEORY IT CANNOT TELL US HOW THE UNIVERSE STARTED OFF BECAUSE IT PREDICTS THAT ALL PHYSICAL THEORIES INCLUDING ITSELF BREAK DOWN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE HOWEVER GENERAL RELATIVITY CLAIMS TO BE ONLY A PARTIAL THEORY SO WHAT THE SINGULARITY THEOREMS REALLY SHOW IS THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A TIME IN THE VERY EARLY UNIVERSE WHEN THE UNIVERSE WAS SO SMALL THAT ONE COULD NO LONGER IGNORE THE SMALLSCALE EFFECTS OF THE OTHER GREAT PARTIAL THEORY OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY QUANTUM MECHANICS AT THE START OF THE S THEN WE WERE FORCED TO TURN OUR SEARCH FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSE FROM OUR THEORY OF THE EXTRAORDINARILY VAST TO OUR THEORY OF THE EXTRAORDINARILY TINY THAT THEORY QUANTUM MECHANICS WILL BE DESCRIBED NEXT BEFORE WE TURN TO THE EFFORTS TO COMBINE THE TWO PARTIAL THEORIES INTO A SINGLE QUANTUM THEORY OF GRAVITY THE SUCCESS OF SCIENTIFIC THEORIES PARTICULARLY NEWTONS THEORY OF GRAVITY LED THE FRENCH SCIENTIST THE MARQUIS DE LAPLACE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY TO ARGUE THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS COMPLETELY DETERMINISTIC LAPLACE SUGGESTED THAT THERE SHOULD BE A SET OF SCIENTIFIC LAWS THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO PREDICT EVERYTHING THAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE UNIVERSE IF ONLY WE KNEW THE COMPLETE STATE OF THE UNIVERSE AT ONE TIME FOR EXAMPLE IF WE KNEW THE POSITIONS AND SPEEDS OF THE SUN AND THE PLANETS AT ONE TIME THEN WE COULD USE NEWTONS LAWS TO CALCULATE THE STATE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AT ANY OTHER TIME DETERMINISM SEEMS FAIRLY OBVIOUS IN THIS CASE BUT LAPLACE WENT FURTHER TO ASSUME THAT THERE WERE SIMILAR LAWS GOVERNING EVERYTHING ELSE INCLUDING HUMAN BEHAVIOR THE DOCTRINE OF SCIENTIFIC DETERMINISM WAS STRONGLY RESISTED BY MANY PEOPLE WHO FELT THAT IT INFRINGED GODS FREEDOM TO INTERVENE IN THE WORLD BUT IT REMAINED THE STANDARD ASSUMPTION OF SCIENCE UNTIL THE EARLY YEARS OF THIS CENTURY ONE OF THE FIRST INDICATIONS THAT THIS BELIEF WOULD HAVE TO BE ABANDONED CAME WHEN CALCULATIONS BY THE BRITISH SCIENTISTS LORD RAYLEIGH AND SIR JAMES JEANS SUGGESTED THAT A HOT OBJECT OR BODY SUCH AS A STAR MUST RADIATE ENERGY AT AN INFINITE RATE ACCORDING TO THE LAWS WE BELIEVED AT THE TIME A HOT BODY OUGHT TO GIVE OFF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES SUCH AS RADIO WAVES VISIBLE LIGHT OR X RAYS EQUALLY AT ALL FREQUENCIES FOR EXAMPLE A HOT BODY SHOULD RADIATE THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY IN WAVES WITH FREQUENCIES BETWEEN ONE AND TWO MILLION MILLION WAVES A SECOND AS IN WAVES WITH FREQUENCIES BETWEEN TWO AND THREE MILLION MILLION WAVES A SECOND NOW SINCE THE NUMBER OF WAVES A SECOND IS UNLIMITED THIS WOULD MEAN THAT THE TOTAL ENERGY RADIATED WOULD BE INFINITE IN ORDER TO AVOID THIS OBVIOUSLY RIDICULOUS RESULT THE GERMAN SCIENTIST MAX PLANCK SUGGESTED IN THAT LIGHT X RAYS AND OTHER WAVES COULD NOT BE EMITTED AT AN ARBITRARY RATE BUT ONLY IN CERTAIN PACKETS THAT HE CALLED QUANTA MOREOVER EACH QUANTUM HAD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT WAS GREATER THE HIGHER THE FREQUENCY OF THE WAVES SO AT A HIGH ENOUGH FREQUENCY THE EMISSION OF A SINGLE QUANTUM WOULD REQUIRE MORE ENERGY THAN WAS AVAILABLE THUS THE RADIATION AT HIGH FREQUENCIES WOULD BE REDUCED AND SO THE RATE AT WHICH THE BODY LOST ENERGY WOULD BE FINITE THE QUANTUM HYPOTHESIS EXPLAINED THE OBSERVED RATE OF EMISSION OF RADIATION FROM HOT BODIES VERY WELL BUT ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR DETERMINISM WERE NOT REALIZED UNTIL WHEN ANOTHER GERMAN SCIENTIST WERNER HEISENBERG FORMULATED HIS FAMOUS UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IN ORDER TO PREDICT THE FUTURE POSITION AND VELOCITY OF A PARTICLE ONE HAS TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE ITS PRESENT POSITION AND VELOCITY ACCURATELY THE OBVIOUS WAY TO DO THIS IS TO SHINE LIGHT ON THE PARTICLE SOME OF THE WAVES OF LIGHT WILL BE SCATTERED BY THE PARTICLE AND THIS WILL INDICATE ITS POSITION HOWEVER ONE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE PARTICLE MORE ACCURATELY THAN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE WAVE CRESTS OF LIGHT SO ONE NEEDS TO USE LIGHT OF A SHORT WAVELENGTH IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE POSITION OF THE PARTICLE PRECISELY NOW BY PLANCKS QUANTUM HYPOTHESIS ONE CANNOT USE AN ARBITRARILY SMALL AMOUNT OF LIGHT ONE HAS TO USE AT LEAST ONE QUANTUM THIS QUANTUM WILL DISTURB THE PARTICLE AND CHANGE ITS VELOCITY IN A WAY THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED MOREOVER THE MORE ACCURATELY ONE MEASURES THE POSITION THE SHORTER THE WAVELENGTH OF THE LIGHT THAT ONE NEEDS AND HENCE THE HIGHER THE ENERGY OF A SINGLE QUANTUM SO THE VELOCITY OF THE PARTICLE WILL BE DISTURBED BY A LARGER AMOUNT IN OTHER WORDS THE MORE ACCURATELY YOU TRY TO MEASURE THE POSITION OF THE PARTICLE THE LESS ACCURATELY YOU CAN MEASURE ITS SPEED AND VICE VERSA HEISENBERG SHOWED THAT THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE POSITION OF THE PARTICLE TIMES THE UNCERTAINTY IN ITS VELOCITY TIMES THE MASS OF THE PARTICLE CAN NEVER BE SMALLER THAN A CERTAIN QUANTITY WHICH IS KNOWN AS PLANCKS CONSTANT MOREOVER THIS LIMIT DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE WAY IN WHICH ONE TRIES TO MEASURE THE POSITION OR VELOCITY OF THE PARTICLE OR ON THE TYPE OF PARTICLE HEISENBERGS UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IS A FUNDAMENTAL INESCAPABLE PROPERTY OF THE WORLD THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE HAD PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WAY IN WHICH WE VIEW THE WORLD EVEN AFTER MORE THAN SEVENTY YEARS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY APPRECIATED BY MANY PHILOSOPHERS AND ARE STILL THE SUBJECT OF MUCH CONTROVERSY THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE SIGNALED AN END TO LAPLACES DREAM OF A THEORY OF SCIENCE A MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY DETERMINISTIC ONE CERTAINLY CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE EVENTS EXACTLY IF ONE CANNOT EVEN MEASURE THE PRESENT STATE OF THE UNIVERSE PRECISELY WE COULD STILL IMAGINE THAT THERE IS A SET OF LAWS THAT DETERMINE EVENTS COMPLETELY FOR SOME SUPERNATURAL BEING WHO COULD OBSERVE THE PRESENT STATE OF THE UNIVERSE WITHOUT DISTURBING IT HOWEVER SUCH MODELS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE NOT OF MUCH INTEREST TO US ORDINARY MORTALS IT SEEMS BETTER TO EMPLOY THE PRINCIPLE OF ECONOMY KNOWN AS OCCAMS RAZOR AND CUT OUT ALL THE FEATURES OF THE THEORY THAT CANNOT BE OBSERVED THIS APPROACH LED HEISENBERG ERWIN SCHRODINGER AND PAUL DIRAC IN THE S TO REFORMULATE MECHANICS INTO A NEW THEORY CALLED QUANTUM MECHANICS BASED ON THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IN THIS THEORY PARTICLES NO LONGER HAD SEPARATE WELLDEFINED POSITIONS AND VELOCITIES THAT COULD NOT BE OBSERVED INSTEAD THEY HAD A QUANTUM STATE WHICH WAS A COMBINATION OF POSITION AND VELOCITY IN GENERAL QUANTUM MECHANICS DOES NOT PREDICT A SINGLE DEFINITE RESULT FOR AN OBSERVATION INSTEAD IT PREDICTS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT POSSIBLE OUTCOMES AND TELLS US HOW LIKELY EACH OF THESE IS THAT IS TO SAY IF ONE MADE THE SAME MEASUREMENT ON A LARGE NUMBER OF SIMILAR SYSTEMS EACH OF WHICH STARTED OFF IN THE SAME WAY ONE WOULD FIND THAT THE RESULT OF THE MEASUREMENT WOULD BE A IN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CASES B IN A DIFFERENT NUMBER AND SO ON ONE COULD PREDICT THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT THE RESULT WOULD BE A OR B BUT ONE COULD NOT PREDICT THE SPECIFIC RESULT OF AN INDIVIDUAL MEASUREMENT QUANTUM MECHANICS THEREFORE INTRODUCES AN UNAVOIDABLE ELEMENT OF UNPREDICTABILITY OR RANDOMNESS INTO SCIENCE EINSTEIN OBJECTED TO THIS VERY STRONGLY DESPITE THE IMPORTANT ROLE HE HAD PLAYED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE IDEAS EINSTEIN WAS AWARDED THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR HIS CONTRIBUTION TO QUANTUM THEORY NEVERTHELESS EINSTEIN NEVER ACCEPTED THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS GOVERNED BY CHANCE HIS FEELINGS WERE SUMMED UP IN HIS FAMOUS STATEMENT GOD DOES NOT PLAY DICE MOST OTHER SCIENTISTS HOWEVER WERE WILLING TO ACCEPT QUANTUM MECHANICS BECAUSE IT AGREED PERFECTLY WITH EXPERIMENT INDEED IT HAS BEEN AN OUTSTANDINGLY SUCCESSFUL THEORY AND UNDERLIES NEARLY ALL OF MODERN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IT GOVERNS THE BEHAVIOR OF TRANSISTORS AND INTEGRATED CIRCUITS WHICH ARE THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES SUCH AS TELEVISIONS AND COMPUTERS AND IS ALSO THE BASIS OF MODERN CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY THE ONLY AREAS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE INTO WHICH QUANTUM MECHANICS HAS NOT YET BEEN PROPERLY INCORPORATED ARE GRAVITY AND THE LARGESCALE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE ALTHOUGH LIGHT IS MADE UP OF WAVES PLANCKS QUANTUM HYPOTHESIS TELLS US THAT IN SOME WAYS IT BEHAVES AS IF IT WERE COMPOSED OF PARTICLES IT CAN BE EMITTED OR ABSORBED ONLY IN PACKETS OR QUANTA EQUALLY HEISENBERGS UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IMPLIES THAT PARTICLES BEHAVE IN SOME RESPECTS LIKE WAVES THEY DO NOT HAVE A DEFINITE POSITION BUT ARE SMEARED OUT WITH A CERTAIN PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION THE THEORY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IS BASED ON AN ENTIRELY NEW TYPE OF MATHEMATICS THAT NO LONGER DESCRIBES THE REAL WORLD IN TERMS OF PARTICLES AND WAVES IT IS ONLY THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE WORLD THAT MAY BE DESCRIBED IN THOSE TERMS THERE IS THUS A DUALITY BETWEEN WAVES AND PARTICLES IN QUANTUM MECHANICS FOR SOME PURPOSES IT IS HELPFUL TO THINK OF PARTICLES AS WAVES AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES IT IS BETTER TO THINK OF WAVES AS PARTICLES AN IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCE OF THIS IS THAT ONE CAN OBSERVE WHAT IS CALLED INTERFERENCE BETWEEN TWO SETS OF WAVES OR PARTICLES THAT IS TO SAY THE CRESTS OF ONE SET OF WAVES MAY COINCIDE WITH THE TROUGHS OF THE OTHER SET THE TWO SETS OF WAVES THEN CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT RATHER THAN ADDING UP TO A STRONGER WAVE AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT A FAMILIAR EXAMPLE OF INTERFERENCE IN THE CASE OF LIGHT IS THE COLORS THAT ARE OFTEN SEEN IN SOAP BUBBLES THESE ARE CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF LIGHT FROM THE TWO SIDES OF THE THIN FILM OF WATER FORMING THE BUBBLE WHITE LIGHT CONSISTS OF LIGHT WAVES OF ALL DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS OR COLORS FOR CERTAIN WAVELENGTHS THE CRESTS OF THE WAVES REFLECTED FROM ONE SIDE OF THE SOAP FILM COINCIDE WITH THE TROUGHS REFLECTED FROM THE OTHER SIDE THE COLORS CORRESPONDING TO THESE WAVELENGTHS ARE ABSENT FROM THE REFLECTED LIGHT WHICH THEREFORE APPEARS TO BE COLORED INTERFERENCE CAN ALSO OCCUR FOR PARTICLES BECAUSE OF THE DUALITY INTRODUCED BY QUANTUM MECHANICS A FAMOUS EXAMPLE IS THE SOCALLED TWOSLIT EXPERIMENT PARTICULAR COLOR THAT IS OF A PARTICULAR WAVELENGTH MOST OF THE LIGHT WILL HIT THE PARTITION BUT A SMALL AMOUNT WILL GO THROUGH THE SLITS NOW SUPPOSE ONE PLACES A SCREEN ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE PARTITION FROM THE LIGHT ANY POINT ON THE SCREEN WILL RECEIVE WAVES FROM THE TWO SLITS HOWEVER IN GENERAL THE DISTANCE THE LIGHT HAS TO TRAVEL FROM THE SOURCE TO THE SCREEN VIA THE TWO SLITS WILL BE DIFFERENT THIS WILL MEAN THAT THE WAVES FROM THE SLITS WILL NOT BE IN PHASE WITH EACH OTHER WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT THE SCREEN IN SOME PLACES THE WAVES WILL CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT AND IN OTHERS THEY WILL REINFORCE EACH OTHER THE RESULT IS A CHARACTERISTIC PATTERN OF LIGHT AND DARK FRINGES THE REMARKABLE THING IS THAT ONE GETS EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF FRINGES IF ONE REPLACES THE SOURCE OF LIGHT BY A SOURCE OF PARTICLES SUCH AS ELECTRONS WITH A DEFINITE SPEED THIS MEANS THAT THE CORRESPONDING WAVES HAVE A DEFINITE LENGTH IT SEEMS THE MORE PECULIAR BECAUSE IF ONE ONLY HAS ONE SLIT ONE DOES NOT GET ANY FRINGES JUST A UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRONS ACROSS THE SCREEN ONE MIGHT THEREFORE THINK THAT OPENING ANOTHER SLIT WOULD JUST INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ELECTRONS HITTING EACH POINT OF THE SCREEN BUT BECAUSE OF INTERFERENCE IT ACTUALLY DECREASES IT IN SOME PLACES IF ELECTRONS ARE SENT THROUGH THE SLITS ONE AT A TIME ONE WOULD EXPECT EACH TO PASS THROUGH ONE SLIT OR THE OTHER AND SO BEHAVE JUST AS IF THE SLIT IT PASSED THROUGH WERE THE ONLY ONE THERE GIVING A UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION ON THE SCREEN IN REALITY HOWEVER EVEN WHEN THE ELECTRONS ARE SENT ONE AT A TIME THE FRINGES STILL APPEAR EACH ELECTRON THEREFORE MUST BE THE PHENOMENON OF INTERFERENCE BETWEEN PARTICLES HAS BEEN CRUCIAL TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRUCTURE OF ATOMS THE BASIC UNITS OF CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY AND THE BUILDING BLOCKS OUT OF WHICH WE AND EVERYTHING AROUND US ARE MADE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY IT WAS THOUGHT THAT ATOMS WERE RATHER LIKE THE PLANETS ORBITING THE SUN WITH ELECTRONS PARTICLES OF NEGATIVE ELECTRICITY ORBITING AROUND A CENTRAL NUCLEUS WHICH CARRIED POSITIVE ELECTRICITY THE ATTRACTION BETWEEN THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ELECTRICITY WAS SUPPOSED TO KEEP THE ELECTRONS IN THEIR ORBITS IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN THE SUN AND THE PLANETS KEEPS THE PLANETS IN THEIR ORBITS THE TROUBLE WITH THIS WAS THAT THE LAWS OF MECHANICS AND ELECTRICITY BEFORE QUANTUM MECHANICS PREDICTED THAT THE ELECTRONS WOULD LOSE ENERGY AND SO SPIRAL INWARD UNTIL THEY COLLIDED WITH THE NUCLEUS THIS WOULD MEAN THAT THE ATOM AND INDEED ALL MATTER SHOULD RAPIDLY COLLAPSE TO A STATE OF VERY HIGH DENSITY A PARTIAL SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WAS FOUND BY THE DANISH SCIENTIST NIELS BOHR IN HE SUGGESTED THAT MAYBE THE ELECTRONS WERE NOT ABLE TO ORBIT AT JUST ANY DISTANCE FROM THE CENTRAL NUCLEUS BUT ONLY AT CERTAIN SPECIFIED DISTANCES IF ONE ALSO SUPPOSED THAT ONLY ONE OR TWO ELECTRONS COULD ORBIT AT ANY ONE OF THESE DISTANCES THIS WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE ATOM BECAUSE THE ELECTRONS COULD NOT SPIRAL IN ANY FARTHER THAN TO FILL UP THE ORBITS WITH E LEAST DISTANCES AND ENERGIES THIS MODEL EXPLAINED QUITE WELL THE STRUCTURE OF THE SIMPLEST ATOM HYDROGEN WHICH HAS ONLY ONE ELECTRON ORBITING AROUND THE NUCLEUS BUT IT WAS NOT CLEAR HOW ONE OUGHT TO EXTEND IT TO MORE COMPLICATED ATOMS MOREOVER THE IDEA OF A LIMITED SET OF ALLOWED ORBITS SEEMED VERY ARBITRARY THE NEW THEORY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS RESOLVED THIS DIFFICULTY IT REVEALED THAT AN ELECTRON ORBITING AROUND THE NUCLEUS COULD BE THOUGHT OF AS A WAVE WITH A WAVELENGTH THAT DEPENDED ON ITS VELOCITY FOR CERTAIN ORBITS THE LENGTH OF THE ORBIT WOULD CORRESPOND TO A WHOLE NUMBER AS OPPOSED TO A FRACTIONAL NUMBER OF WAVELENGTHS OF THE ELECTRON FOR THESE ORBITS THE WAVE CREST WOULD BE IN THE SAME POSITION EACH TIME ROUND SO THE WAVES WOULD ADD UP THESE ORBITS WOULD CORRESPOND TO BOHRS ALLOWED ORBITS HOWEVER FOR ORBITS WHOSE LENGTHS WERE NOT A WHOLE NUMBER OF WAVELENGTHS EACH WAVE CREST WOULD EVENTUALLY BE CANCELED OUT BY A TROUGH AS THE ELECTRONS WENT ROUND THESE ORBITS WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED A NICE WAY OF VISUALIZING THE WAVEPARTICLE DUALITY IS THE SOCALLED SUM OVER HISTORIES INTRODUCED BY THE AMERICAN SCIENTIST RICHARD FEYNMAN IN THIS APPROACH THE PARTICLE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE A SINGLE HISTORY OR PATH IN SPACETIME AS IT WOULD IN A CLASSICAL NONQUANTUM THEORY INSTEAD IT IS SUPPOSED TO GO FROM A TO B BY EVERY POSSIBLE PATH WITH EACH PATH THERE ARE ASSOCIATED A COUPLE OF NUMBERS ONE REPRESENTS THE SIZE OF A WAVE AND THE OTHER REPRESENTS THE POSITION IN THE CYCLE IE WHETHER IT IS AT A CREST OR A TROUGH THE PROBABILITY OF GOING FROM A TO B IS FOUND BY ADDING UP THE WAVES FOR ALL THE PATHS IN GENERAL IF ONE COMPARES A SET OF NEIGHBORING PATHS THE PHASES OR POSITIONS IN THE CYCLE WILL DIFFER GREATLY THIS MEANS THAT THE WAVES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PATHS WILL ALMOST EXACTLY CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT HOWEVER FOR SOME SETS OF NEIGHBORING PATHS THE PHASE WILL NOT VARY MUCH BETWEEN PATHS THE WAVES FOR THESE PATHS WILL NOT CANCEL OUT SUCH PATHS CORRESPOND TO BOHRS ALLOWED ORBITS WITH THESE IDEAS IN CONCRETE MATHEMATICAL FORM IT WAS RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO CALCULATE THE ALLOWED ORBITS IN MORE COMPLICATED ATOMS AND EVEN IN MOLECULES WHICH ARE MADE UP OF A NUMBER OF ATOMS HELD TOGETHER BY ELECTRONS IN ORBITS THAT GO ROUND MORE THAN ONE NUCLEUS SINCE THE STRUCTURE OF MOLECULES AND THEIR REACTIONS WITH EACH OTHER UNDERLIE ALL OF CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY QUANTUM MECHANICS ALLOWS US IN PRINCIPLE TO PREDICT NEARLY EVERYTHING WE SEE AROUND US WITHIN THE LIMITS SET BY THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IN PRACTICE HOWEVER THE CALCULATIONS REQUIRED FOR SYSTEMS CONTAINING MORE THAN A FEW ELECTRONS ARE SO COMPLICATED THAT WE CANNOT DO THEM EINSTEINS GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY SEEMS TO GOVERN THE LARGESCALE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE IT IS WHAT IS CALLED A CLASSICAL THEORY THAT IS IT DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AS IT SHOULD FOR CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER THEORIES THE REASON THAT THIS DOES NOT LEAD TO ANY DISCREPANCY WITH OBSERVATION IS THAT ALL THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELDS THAT WE NORMALLY EXPERIENCE ARE VERY WEAK HOWEVER THE SINGULARITY THEOREMS DISCUSSED EARLIER INDICATE THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD SHOULD GET VERY STRONG IN AT LEAST TWO SITUATIONS BLACK HOLES AND THE BIG BANG IN SUCH STRONG FIELDS THE EFFECTS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS SHOULD BE IMPORTANT THUS IN A SENSE CLASSICAL GENERAL RELATIVITY BY PREDICTING POINTS OF INFINITE DENSITY PREDICTS ITS OWN DOWNFALL JUST AS CLASSICAL THAT IS NONQUANTUM MECHANICS PREDICTED ITS DOWNFALL BY SUGGESTING THAT ATOMS SHOULD COLLAPSE TO INFINITE DENSITY WE DO NOT YET HAVE A COMPLETE CONSISTENT THEORY THAT UNIFIES GENERAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS BUT WE DO KNOW A NUMBER OF THE FEATURES IT SHOULD HAVE THE CONSEQUENCES THAT THESE WOULD HAVE FOR BLACK HOLES AND THE BIG BANG WILL BE DESCRIBED IN LATER CHAPTERS FOR THE MOMENT HOWEVER WE SHALL TURN TO THE RECENT ATTEMPTS TO BRING TOGETHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE OTHER FORCES OF NATURE ARISTOTLE BELIEVED THAT ALL THE MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE WAS MADE UP OF FOUR BASIC ELEMENTS EARTH AIR FIRE AND WATER THESE ELEMENTS WERE ACTED ON BY TWO FORCES GRAVITY THE TENDENCY FOR EARTH AND WATER TO SINK AND LEVITY THE TENDENCY FOR AIR AND FIRE TO RISE THIS DIVISION OF THE CONTENTS OF THE UNIVERSE INTO MATTER AND FORCES IS STILL USED TODAY ARISTOTLE BELIEVED THAT MATTER WAS CONTINUOUS THAT IS ONE COULD DIVIDE A PIECE OF MATTER INTO SMALLER AND SMALLER BITS WITHOUT ANY LIMIT ONE NEVER CAME UP AGAINST A GRAIN OF MATTER THAT COULD NOT BE DIVIDED FURTHER A FEW GREEKS HOWEVER SUCH AS DEMOCRITUS HELD THAT MATTER WAS INHERENTLY GRAINY AND THAT EVERYTHING WAS MADE UP OF LARGE NUMBERS OF VARIOUS DIFFERENT KINDS OF ATOMS THE WORD ATOM MEANS INDIVISIBLE IN GREEK FOR CENTURIES THE ARGUMENT CONTINUED WITHOUT ANY REAL EVIDENCE ON EITHER SIDE BUT IN THE BRITISH CHEMIST AND PHYSICIST JOHN DALTON POINTED OUT THAT THE FACT THAT CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS ALWAYS COMBINED IN CERTAIN PROPORTIONS COULD BE EXPLAINED BY THE GROUPING TOGETHER OF ATOMS TO FORM UNITS CALLED MOLECULES HOWEVER THE ARGUMENT BETWEEN THE TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT WAS NOT FINALLY SETTLED IN FAVOR OF THE ATOMISTS UNTIL THE EARLY YEARS OF THIS CENTURY ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PIECES OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WAS PROVIDED BY EINSTEIN IN A PAPER WRITTEN IN A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE FAMOUS PAPER ON SPECIAL RELATIVITY EINSTEIN POINTED OUT THAT WHAT WAS CALLED BROWNIAN MOTION THE IRREGULAR RANDOM MOTION OF SMALL PARTICLES OF DUST SUSPENDED IN A LIQUID COULD BE EXPLAINED AS THE EFFECT OF ATOMS OF THE LIQUID COLLIDING WITH THE DUST PARTICLES BY THIS TIME THERE WERE ALREADY SUSPICIONS THAT THESE ATOMS WERE NOT AFTER ALL INDIVISIBLE SEVERAL YEARS PREVIOUSLY A FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE J J THOMSON HAD DEMONSTRATED THE EXISTENCE OF A PARTICLE OF MATTER CALLED THE ELECTRON THAT HAD A MASS LESS THAN ONE THOUSANDTH OF THAT OF THE LIGHTEST ATOM HE USED A SETUP RATHER LIKE A MODERN TV PICTURE TUBE A REDHOT METAL FILAMENT GAVE OFF THE ELECTRONS AND BECAUSE THESE HAVE A NEGATIVE ELECTRIC CHARGE AN ELECTRIC FIELD COULD BE USED TO ACCELERATE THEM TOWARD A PHOSPHORCOATED SCREEN WHEN THEY HIT THE SCREEN FLASHES OF LIGHT WERE GENERATED SOON IT WAS REALIZED THAT THESE ELECTRONS MUST BE COMING FROM WITHIN THE ATOMS THEMSELVES AND IN  THE NEW ZEALAND PHYSICIST ERNEST RUTHERFORD FINALLY SHOWED THAT THE ATOMS OF MATTER DO HAVE INTERNAL STRUCTURE THEY ARE MADE UP OF AN EXTREMELY TINY POSITIVELY CHARGED NUCLEUS AROUND WHICH A NUMBER OF ELECTRONS ORBIT HE DEDUCED THIS BY ANALYZING THE WAY IN WHICH ALPHAPARTICLES WHICH ARE POSITIVELY CHARGED PARTICLES GIVEN OFF BY RADIOACTIVE ATOMS ARE DEFLECTED WHEN THEY COLLIDE WITH ATOMS AT FIRST IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE NUCLEUS OF THE ATOM WAS MADE UP OF ELECTRONS AND DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF A POSITIVELY CHARGED PARTICLE CALLED THE PROTON FROM THE GREEK WORD MEANING FIRST BECAUSE IT WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT FROM WHICH MATTER WAS MADE HOWEVER IN A COLLEAGUE OF RUTHERFORDS AT CAMBRIDGE JAMES CHADWICK DISCOVERED THAT THE NUCLEUS CONTAINED ANOTHER PARTICLE CALLED THE NEUTRON WHICH HAD ALMOST THE SAME MASS AS A PROTON BUT NO ELECTRICAL CHARGE CHADWICK RECEIVED THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR HIS DISCOVERY AND WAS ELECTED MASTER OF GONVILLE AND CAIUS COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE THE COLLEGE OF WHICH I AM NOW A FELLOW HE LATER RESIGNED AS MASTER BECAUSE OF DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE FELLOWS THERE HAD BEEN A BITTER DISPUTE IN THE COLLEGE EVER SINCE A GROUP OF YOUNG FELLOWS RETURNING AFTER THE WAR HAD VOTED MANY OF THE OLD FELLOWS OUT OF THE COLLEGE OFFICES THEY HAD HELD FOR A LONG TIME THIS WAS BEFORE MY TIME I JOINED THE COLLEGE IN AT THE TAIL END OF THE BITTERNESS WHEN SIMILAR DISAGREEMENTS FORCED ANOTHER NOBEL PRIZE WINNING MASTER SIR NEVILL MOTT TO RESIGN UP TO ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO IT WAS THOUGHT THAT PROTONS AND NEUTRONS WERE ELEMENTARY PARTICLES BUT EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH PROTONS WERE COLLIDED WITH OTHER PROTONS OR ELECTRONS AT HIGH SPEEDS INDICATED THAT THEY WERE IN FACT MADE UP OF SMALLER PARTICLES THESE PARTICLES WERE NAMED QUARKS BY THE CALTECH PHYSICIST MURRAY GELLMANN WHO WON THE NOBEL PRIZE IN FOR HIS WORK ON THEM THE ORIGIN OF THE NAME IS AN ENIGMATIC QUOTATION FROM JAMES JOYCE THREE QUARKS FOR MUSTER MARK THE WORD QUARK IS SUPPOSED TO BE PRONOUNCED LIKE QUART BUT WITH A K AT THE END INSTEAD OF A T BUT IS USUALLY PRONOUNCED TO RHYME WITH LARK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF QUARKS THERE ARE SIX FLAVORS WHICH WE CALL UP DOWN STRANGE CHARMED BOTTOM AND TOP THE FIRST THREE FLAVORS HAD BEEN KNOWN SINCE THE S BUT THE CHARMED QUARK WAS DISCOVERED ONLY IN  THE BOTTOM IN AND THE TOP IN EACH FLAVOR COMES IN THREE COLORS RED GREEN AND BLUE IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT THESE TERMS ARE JUST LABELS QUARKS ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN THE WAVELENGTH OF VISIBLE LIGHT AND SO DO NOT HAVE ANY COLOR IN THE NORMAL SENSE IT IS JUST THAT MODERN PHYSICISTS SEEM TO HAVE MORE IMAGINATIVE WAYS OF NAMING NEW PARTICLES AND PHENOMENA THEY NO LONGER RESTRICT THEMSELVES TO GREEK A PROTON OR NEUTRON IS MADE UP OF THREE QUARKS ONE OF EACH COLOR A PROTON CONTAINS TWO UP QUARKS AND ONE DOWN QUARK A NEUTRON CONTAINS TWO DOWN AND ONE UP WE CAN CREATE PARTICLES MADE UP OF THE OTHER QUARKS STRANGE CHARMED BOTTOM AND TOP BUT THESE ALL HAVE A MUCH GREATER MASS AND DECAY VERY RAPIDLY INTO PROTONS AND NEUTRONS WE NOW KNOW THAT NEITHER THE ATOMS NOR THE PROTONS AND NEUTRONS WITHIN THEM ARE INDIVISIBLE SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE TRULY ELEMENTARY PARTICLES THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS FROM WHICH EVERYTHING IS MADE SINCE THE WAVELENGTH OF LIGHT IS MUCH LARGER THAN THE SIZE OF AN ATOM WE CANNOT HOPE TO LOOK AT THE PARTS OF AN ATOM IN THE ORDINARY WAY WE NEED TO USE SOMETHING WITH A MUCH SMALLER WAVELENGTH AS WE SAW IN THE LAST CHAPTER QUANTUM MECHANICS TELLS US THAT ALL PARTICLES ARE IN FACT WAVES AND THAT THE HIGHER THE ENERGY OF A PARTICLE THE SMALLER THE WAVELENGTH OF THE CORRESPONDING WAVE SO THE BEST ANSWER WE CAN GIVE TO OUR QUESTION DEPENDS ON HOW HIGH A PARTICLE ENERGY WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL BECAUSE THIS DETERMINES ON HOW SMALL A LENGTH SCALE WE CAN LOOK THESE PARTICLE ENERGIES ARE USUALLY MEASURED IN UNITS CALLED ELECTRON VOLTS IN THOMSONS EXPERIMENTS WITH ELECTRONS WE SAW THAT HE USED AN ELECTRIC FIELD TO ACCELERATE THE ELECTRONS THE ENERGY THAT AN ELECTRON GAINS FROM AN ELECTRIC FIELD OF ONE VOLT IS WHAT IS KNOWN AS AN ELECTRON VOLT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHEN THE ONLY PARTICLE ENERGIES THAT PEOPLE KNEW HOW TO USE WERE THE LOW ENERGIES OF A FEW ELECTRON VOLTS GENERATED BY CHEMICAL REACTIONS SUCH AS BURNING IT WAS THOUGHT THAT ATOMS WERE THE SMALLEST UNIT IN RUTHERFORDS EXPERIMENT THE ALPHAPARTICLES HAD ENERGIES OF MILLIONS OF ELECTRON VOLTS MORE RECENTLY WE HAVE LEARNED HOW TO USE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS TO GIVE PARTICLES ENERGIES OF AT FIRST MILLIONS AND THEN THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF ELECTRON VOLTS AND SO WE KNOW THAT PARTICLES THAT WERE THOUGHT TO BE ELEMENTARY THIRTY YEARS AGO ARE IN FACT MADE UP OF SMALLER PARTICLES MAY THESE AS WE GO TO STILL HIGHER ENERGIES IN TURN BE FOUND TO BE MADE FROM STILL SMALLER PARTICLES THIS IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE BUT WE DO HAVE SOME THEORETICAL REASONS FOR BELIEVING THAT WE HAVE OR ARE VERY NEAR TO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE ULTIMATE BUILDING BLOCKS OF NATURE USING THE WAVEPARTICLE DUALITY DISCUSSED IN THE LAST CHAPTER EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE INCLUDING LIGHT AND GRAVITY CAN BE DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF PARTICLES THESE PARTICLES HAVE A PROPERTY CALLED SPIN ONE WAY OF THINKING OF SPIN IS TO IMAGINE THE PARTICLES AS LITTLE TOPS SPINNING ABOUT AN AXIS HOWEVER THIS CAN BE MISLEADING BECAUSE QUANTUM MECHANICS TELLS US THAT THE PARTICLES DO NOT HAVE ANY WELLDEFINED AXIS WHAT THE SPIN OF A PARTICLE REALLY TELLS US IS WHAT THE PARTICLE LOOKS LIKE FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS A PARTICLE OF SPIN IS LIKE A DOT IT LOOKS THE SAME FROM EVERY DIRECTION FIGURE I ON THE OTHER HAND A PARTICLE OF SPIN IS LIKE AN ARROW IT LOOKS DIFFERENT FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS FIGURE II ONLY IF ONE TURNS IT ROUND A COMPLETE REVOLUTION DEGREES DOES THE PARTICLE LOOK THE SAME A PARTICLE OF SPIN IS LIKE A DOUBLEHEADED ARROW FIGURE III IT LOOKS THE SAME IF ONE TURNS IT ROUND HALF A REVOLUTION DEGREES SIMILARLY HIGHER SPIN PARTICLES LOOK THE SAME IF ONE TURNS THEM THROUGH SMALLER FRACTIONS OF A COMPLETE REVOLUTION ALL THIS SEEMS FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT THE REMARKABLE FACT IS THAT THERE ARE PARTICLES THAT DO NOT LOOK THE SAME IF ONE TURNS THEM THROUGH JUST ONE REVOLUTION YOU HAVE TO TURN THEM THROUGH TWO COMPLETE REVOLUTIONS SUCH PARTICLES ARE SAID TO HAVE SPIN ALL THE KNOWN PARTICLES IN THE UNIVERSE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS PARTICLES OF SPIN  WHICH MAKE UP THE MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE AND PARTICLES OF SPIN AND WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE GIVE RISE TO FORCES BETWEEN THE MATTER PARTICLES THE MATTER PARTICLES OBEY WHAT IS CALLED PAULIS EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE THIS WAS DISCOVERED IN BY AN AUSTRIAN PHYSICIST WOLFGANG PAULI FOR WHICH HE RECEIVED THE NOBEL PRIZE IN HE WAS THE ARCHETYPAL THEORETICAL PHYSICIST IT WAS SAID OF HIM THAT EVEN HIS PRESENCE IN THE SAME TOWN WOULD MAKE EXPERIMENTS GO WRONG PAULIS EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE SAYS THAT TWO SIMILAR PARTICLES CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME STATE THAT IS THEY CANNOT HAVE BOTH THE SAME POSITION AND THE SAME VELOCITY WITHIN THE LIMITS GIVEN BY THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS WHY MATTER PARTICLES DO NOT COLLAPSE TO A STATE OF VERY HIGH DENSITY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE FORCES PRODUCED BY THE PARTICLES OF SPIN AND IF THE MATTER PARTICLES HAVE VERY NEARLY THE SAME POSITIONS THEY MUST HAVE DIFFERENT VELOCITIES WHICH MEANS THAT THEY WILL NOT STAY IN THE SAME POSITION FOR LONG IF THE WORLD HAD BEEN CREATED WITHOUT THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE QUARKS WOULD NOT FORM SEPARATE WELLDEFINED PROTONS AND NEUTRONS NOR WOULD THESE TOGETHER WITH ELECTRONS FORM SEPARATE WELLDEFINED ATOMS THEY WOULD ALL COLLAPSE TO FORM A ROUGHLY UNIFORM DENSE SOUP A PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ELECTRON AND OTHER SPIN PARTICLES DID NOT COME UNTIL WHEN A THEORY WAS PROPOSED BY PAUL DIRAC WHO LATER WAS ELECTED TO THE LUCASIAN PROFESSORSHIP OF MATHEMATICS AT CAMBRIDGE THE SAME PROFESSORSHIP THAT NEWTON HAD ONCE HELD AND THAT I NOW HOLD DIRACS THEORY WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH BOTH QUANTUM MECHANICS AND THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY IT EXPLAINED MATHEMATICALLY WHY THE ELECTRON HAD SPIN THAT IS WHY IT DIDNT LOOK THE SAME IF YOU TURNED IT THROUGH ONLY ONE COMPLETE REVOLUTION BUT DID IF YOU TURNED IT THROUGH TWO REVOLUTIONS IT ALSO PREDICTED THAT THE ELECTRON SHOULD HAVE A PARTNER AN ANTIELECTRON OR POSITRON THE DISCOVERY OF THE POSITRON IN CONFIRMED DIRACS THEORY AND LED TO HIS BEING AWARDED THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR PHYSICS IN  WE NOW KNOW THAT EVERY PARTICLE HAS AN ANTIPARTICLE WITH WHICH IT CAN ANNIHILATE IN THE CASE OF THE FORCECARRYING PARTICLES THE ANTIPARTICLES ARE THE SAME AS THE PARTICLES THEMSELVES THERE COULD BE WHOLE ANTIWORLDS AND ANTIPEOPLE MADE OUT OF ANTIPARTICLES HOWEVER IF YOU MEET YOUR ANTISELF DONT SHAKE HANDS YOU WOULD BOTH VANISH IN A GREAT FLASH OF LIGHT THE QUESTION OF WHY THERE SEEM TO BE SO MANY MORE PARTICLES THAN ANTIPARTICLES AROUND US IS EXTREMELY IN QUANTUM MECHANICS THE FORCES OR INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MATTER PARTICLES ARE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE CARRIED BY PARTICLES OF INTEGER SPIN OR WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT A MATTER PARTICLE SUCH AS AN ELECTRON OR A QUARK EMITS A FORCECARRYING PARTICLE THE RECOIL FROM THIS EMISSION CHANGES THE VELOCITY OF THE MATTER PARTICLE THE FORCECARRYING PARTICLE THEN COLLIDES WITH ANOTHER MATTER PARTICLE AND IS ABSORBED THIS COLLISION CHANGES THE VELOCITY OF THE SECOND PARTICLE JUST AS IF THERE HAD BEEN A FORCE BETWEEN THE TWO MATTER PARTICLES IT IS AN IMPORTANT PROPERTY OF THE FORCECARRYING PARTICLES THAT THEY DO NOT OBEY THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE THIS MEANS THAT THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE NUMBER THAT CAN BE EXCHANGED AND SO THEY CAN GIVE RISE TO A STRONG FORCE HOWEVER IF THE FORCECARRYING PARTICLES HAVE A HIGH MASS IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE AND EXCHANGE THEM OVER A LARGE DISTANCE SO THE FORCES THAT THEY CARRY WILL HAVE ONLY A SHORT RANGE ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE FORCECARRYING PARTICLES HAVE NO MASS OF THEIR OWN THE FORCES WILL BE LONG RANGE THE FORCECARRYING PARTICLES EXCHANGED BETWEEN MATTER PARTICLES ARE SAID TO BE VIRTUAL PARTICLES BECAUSE UNLIKE REAL PARTICLES THEY CANNOT BE DIRECTLY DETECTED BY A PARTICLE DETECTOR WE KNOW THEY EXIST HOWEVER BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE A MEASURABLE EFFECT THEY GIVE RISE TO FORCES BETWEEN MATTER PARTICLES PARTICLES OF SPIN OR DO ALSO EXIST IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES AS REAL PARTICLES WHEN THEY CAN BE DIRECTLY DETECTED THEY THEN APPEAR TO US AS WHAT A CLASSICAL PHYSICIST WOULD CALL WAVES SUCH AS WAVES OF LIGHT OR GRAVITATIONAL WAVES THEY MAY SOMETIMES BE EMITTED WHEN MATTER PARTICLES INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER BY EXCHANGING VIRTUAL FORCECARRYING PARTICLES FOR EXAMPLE THE ELECTRIC REPULSIVE FORCE BETWEEN TWO ELECTRONS IS DUE TO THE EXCHANGE OF VIRTUAL PHOTONS WHICH CAN NEVER BE DIRECTLY DETECTED BUT IF ONE ELECTRON MOVES PAST ANOTHER REAL PHOTONS MAY BE GIVEN OFF WHICH WE DETECT AS LIGHT WAVES FORCECARRYING PARTICLES CAN BE GROUPED INTO FOUR CATEGORIES ACCORDING TO THE STRENGTH OF THE FORCE THAT THEY CARRY AND THE PARTICLES WITH WHICH THEY INTERACT IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT THIS DIVISION INTO FOUR CLASSES IS MANMADE IT IS CONVENIENT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF PARTIAL THEORIES BUT IT MAY NOT CORRESPOND TO ANYTHING DEEPER ULTIMATELY MOST PHYSICISTS HOPE TO FIND A UNIFIED THEORY THAT WILL EXPLAIN ALL FOUR FORCES AS DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF A SINGLE FORCE INDEED MANY WOULD SAY THIS IS THE PRIME GOAL OF PHYSICS TODAY RECENTLY SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO UNIFY THREE OF THE FOUR CATEGORIES OF FORCE AND I SHALL DESCRIBE THESE IN THIS CHAPTER THE QUESTION OF THE UNIFICATION OF THE REMAINING CATEGORY GRAVITY WE SHALL LEAVE TILL LATER THE FIRST CATEGORY IS THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE THIS FORCE IS UNIVERSAL THAT IS EVERY PARTICLE FEELS THE FORCE OF GRAVITY ACCORDING TO ITS MASS OR ENERGY GRAVITY IS THE WEAKEST OF THE FOUR FORCES BY A LONG WAY IT IS SO WEAK THAT WE WOULD NOT NOTICE IT AT ALL WERE IT NOT FOR TWO SPECIAL PROPERTIES THAT IT HAS IT CAN ACT OVER LARGE DISTANCES AND IT IS ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE THIS MEANS THAT THE VERY WEAK GRAVITATIONAL FORCES BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL PARTICLES IN TWO LARGE BODIES SUCH AS THE EARTH AND THE SUN CAN ALL ADD UP TO PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT FORCE THE OTHER THREE FORCES ARE EITHER SHORT RANGE OR ARE SOMETIMES ATTRACTIVE AND SOMETIMES REPULSIVE SO THEY TEND TO CANCEL OUT IN THE QUANTUM MECHANICAL WAY OF LOOKING AT THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD THE FORCE BETWEEN TWO MATTER PARTICLES IS PICTURED AS BEING CARRIED BY A PARTICLE OF SPIN CALLED THE GRAVITON THIS HAS NO MASS OF ITS OWN SO THE FORCE THAT IT CARRIES IS LONG RANGE THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE BETWEEN THE SUN AND THE EARTH IS ASCRIBED TO THE EXCHANGE OF GRAVITONS BETWEEN THE PARTICLES THAT MAKE UP THESE TWO BODIES ALTHOUGH THE EXCHANGED PARTICLES ARE VIRTUAL THEY CERTAINLY DO PRODUCE A MEASURABLE EFFECT THEY MAKE THE EARTH ORBIT THE SUN REAL GRAVITONS MAKE UP WHAT CLASSICAL PHYSICISTS WOULD CALL GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WHICH ARE VERY WEAK AND SO DIFFICULT TO DETECT THAT THEY HAVE NOT YET BEEN OBSERVED THE NEXT CATEGORY IS THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE WHICH INTERACTS WITH ELECTRICALLY CHARGED PARTICLES LIKE ELECTRONS AND QUARKS BUT NOT WITH UNCHARGED PARTICLES SUCH AS GRAVITONS IT IS MUCH STRONGER THAN THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE BETWEEN TWO ELECTRONS IS ABOUT A MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION WITH FORTYTWO ZEROS AFTER IT TIMES BIGGER THAN THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE HOWEVER THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF ELECTRIC CHARGE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE THE FORCE BETWEEN TWO POSITIVE CHARGES IS REPULSIVE AS IS THE FORCE BETWEEN TWO NEGATIVE CHARGES BUT THE FORCE IS ATTRACTIVE BETWEEN A POSITIVE AND A NEGATIVE CHARGE A LARGE BODY SUCH AS THE EARTH OR THE SUN CONTAINS NEARLY EQUAL NUMBERS OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CHARGES THUS THE ATTRACTIVE AND REPULSIVE FORCES BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL PARTICLES NEARLY CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE NET ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE HOWEVER ON THE SMALL SCALES OF ATOMS AND MOLECULES ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCES DOMINATE THE ELECTROMAGNETIC ATTRACTION BETWEEN NEGATIVELY CHARGED ELECTRONS AND POSITIVELY CHARGED PROTONS IN THE NUCLEUS CAUSES THE ELECTRONS TO ORBIT THE NUCLEUS OF THE ATOM JUST AS GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION CAUSES THE EARTH TO ORBIT THE SUN THE ELECTROMAGNETIC ATTRACTION IS PICTURED AS BEING CAUSED BY THE EXCHANGE OF LARGE NUMBERS OF VIRTUAL MASSLESS PARTICLES OF SPIN CALLED PHOTONS AGAIN THE PHOTONS THAT ARE EXCHANGED ARE VIRTUAL PARTICLES HOWEVER WHEN AN ELECTRON CHANGES FROM ONE ALLOWED ORBIT TO ANOTHER ONE NEARER TO THE NUCLEUS ENERGY IS RELEASED AND A REAL PHOTON IS EMITTED WHICH CAN BE OBSERVED AS VISIBLE LIGHT BY THE HUMAN EYE IF IT HAS THE RIGHT WAVELENGTH OR BY A PHOTON DETECTOR SUCH AS PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM EQUALLY IF A REAL PHOTON COLLIDES WITH AN ATOM IT MAY MOVE AN ELECTRON FROM AN ORBIT NEARER THE NUCLEUS TO ONE FARTHER AWAY THIS USES UP THE ENERGY OF THE PHOTON SO IT IS ABSORBED THE THIRD CATEGORY IS CALLED THE WEAK NUCLEAR FORCE WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RADIOACTIVITY AND WHICH ACTS ON ALL MATTER PARTICLES OF SPIN BUT NOT ON PARTICLES OF SPIN OR SUCH AS PHOTONS AND GRAVITONS THE WEAK NUCLEAR FORCE WAS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD UNTIL WHEN ABDUS SALAM AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON AND STEVEN WEINBERG AT HARVARD BOTH PROPOSED THEORIES THAT UNIFIED THIS INTERACTION WITH THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE JUST AS MAXWELL HAD UNIFIED ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER THEY SUGGESTED THAT IN ADDITION TO THE PHOTON THERE WERE THREE OTHER SPIN  PARTICLES KNOWN COLLECTIVELY AS MASSIVE VECTOR BOSONS THAT CARRIED THE WEAK FORCE THESE WERE CALLED W PRONOUNCED W PLUS W PRONOUNCED W MINUS AND Z PRONOUNCED Z NAUGHT AND EACH HAD A MASS OF AROUND GEV GEV STANDS FOR GIGAELECTRONVOLT OR ONE THOUSAND MILLION ELECTRON VOLTS THE WEINBERGSALAM THEORY EXHIBITS A PROPERTY KNOWN AS SPONTANEOUS SYMMETRY BREAKING THIS MEANS THAT WHAT APPEAR TO BE A NUMBER OF COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PARTICLES AT LOW ENERGIES ARE IN FACT FOUND TO BE ALL THE SAME TYPE OF PARTICLE ONLY IN DIFFERENT STATES AT HIGH ENERGIES ALL THESE PARTICLES BEHAVE SIMILARLY THE EFFECT IS RATHER LIKE THE BEHAVIOR OF A ROULETTE BALL ON A ROULETTE WHEEL AT HIGH ENERGIES WHEN THE WHEEL IS SPUN QUICKLY THE BALL BEHAVES IN ESSENTIALLY ONLY ONE WAY IT ROLLS ROUND AND ROUND BUT AS THE WHEEL SLOWS THE ENERGY OF THE BALL DECREASES AND EVENTUALLY THE BALL DROPS INTO ONE OF THE THIRTYSEVEN SLOTS IN THE WHEEL IN OTHER WORDS AT LOW ENERGIES THERE ARE THIRTYSEVEN DIFFERENT STATES IN WHICH THE BALL CAN EXIST IF FOR SOME REASON WE COULD ONLY OBSERVE THE BALL AT LOW ENERGIES WE WOULD THEN THINK THAT THERE WERE THIRTYSEVEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF BALL IN THE WEINBERGSALAM THEORY AT ENERGIES MUCH GREATER THAN GEV THE THREE NEW PARTICLES AND THE PHOTON WOULD ALL BEHAVE IN A SIMILAR MANNER BUT AT THE LOWER PARTICLE ENERGIES THAT OCCUR IN MOST NORMAL SITUATIONS THIS SYMMETRY BETWEEN THE PARTICLES WOULD BE BROKEN WE W AND Z WOULD ACQUIRE LARGE MASSES MAKING THE FORCES THEY CARRY HAVE A VERY SHORT RANGE AT THE TIME THAT SALAM AND WEINBERG PROPOSED THEIR THEORY FEW PEOPLE BELIEVED THEM AND PARTICLE ACCELERATORS WERE NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH TO REACH THE ENERGIES OF GEV REQUIRED TO PRODUCE REAL W W OR Z PARTICLES HOWEVER OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS OR SO THE OTHER PREDICTIONS OF THE THEORY AT LOWER ENERGIES AGREED SO WELL WITH EXPERIMENT THAT IN SALAM AND WEINBERG WERE AWARDED THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR PHYSICS TOGETHER WITH SHELDON GLASHOW ALSO AT HARVARD WHO HAD SUGGESTED SIMILAR UNIFIED THEORIES OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC AND WEAK NUCLEAR FORCES THE NOBEL COMMITTEE WAS SPARED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF HAVING MADE A MISTAKE BY THE DISCOVERY IN AT CERN EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR NUCLEAR RESEARCH OF THE THREE MASSIVE PARTNERS OF THE PHOTON WITH THE CORRECT PREDICTED MASSES AND OTHER PROPERTIES CARLO RUBBIA WHO LED THE TEAM OF SEVERAL HUNDRED PHYSICISTS THAT MADE THE DISCOVERY RECEIVED THE NOBEL PRIZE IN ALONG WITH SIMON VAN DER MEER THE CERNENGINEER WHO DEVELOPED THE ANTIMATTER STORAGE SYSTEM EMPLOYED IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE A MARK IN EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS THESE DAYS UNLESS YOU ARE ALREADY AT THE TOP  THE FOURTH CATEGORY IS THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE WHICH HOLDS THE QUARKS TOGETHER IN THE PROTON AND NEUTRON AND HOLDS THE PROTONS AND NEUTRONS TOGETHER IN THE NUCLEUS OF AN ATOM IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS FORCE IS CARRIED BY ANOTHER SPIN PARTICLE CALLED THE GLUON WHICH INTERACTS ONLY WITH ITSELF AND WITH THE QUARKS THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE HAS A CURIOUS PROPERTY CALLED CONFINEMENT IT ALWAYS BINDS PARTICLES TOGETHER INTO COMBINATIONS THAT HAVE NO COLOR ONE CANNOT HAVE A SINGLE QUARK ON ITS OWN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE A COLOR RED GREEN OR BLUE INSTEAD A RED QUARK HAS TO BE JOINED TO A GREEN AND A BLUE QUARK BY A STRING OF GLUONS RED GREEN BLUE WHITE SUCH A TRIPLET CONSTITUTES A PROTON OR A NEUTRON ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS A PAIR CONSISTING OF A QUARK AND AN ANTIQUARK RED ANTIRED OR GREEN ANTIGREEN OR BLUE ANTIBLUE WHITE SUCH COMBINATIONS MAKE UP THE PARTICLES KNOWN AS MESONS WHICH ARE UNSTABLE BECAUSE THE QUARK AND ANTIQUARK CAN ANNIHILATE EACH OTHER PRODUCING ELECTRONS AND OTHER PARTICLES SIMILARLY CONFINEMENT PREVENTS ONE HAVING A SINGLE GLUON ON ITS OWN BECAUSE GLUONS ALSO HAVE COLOR INSTEAD ONE HAS TO HAVE A COLLECTION OF GLUONS WHOSE COLORS ADD UP TO WHITE SUCH A COLLECTION FORMS AN UNSTABLE PARTICLE CALLED A GLUEBALL THE FACT THAT CONFINEMENT PREVENTS ONE FROM OBSERVING AN ISOLATED QUARK OR GLUON MIGHT SEEM TO MAKE THE WHOLE NOTION OF QUARKS AND GLUONS AS PARTICLES SOMEWHAT METAPHYSICAL HOWEVER THERE IS ANOTHER PROPERTY OF THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE CALLED ASYMPTOTIC FREEDOM THAT MAKES THE CONCEPT OF QUARKS AND GLUONS WELL DEFINED AT NORMAL ENERGIES THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE IS INDEED STRONG AND IT BINDS THE QUARKS TIGHTLY TOGETHER HOWEVER EXPERIMENTS WITH LARGE PARTICLE ACCELERATORS INDICATE THAT AT HIGH ENERGIES THE STRONG FORCE BECOMES MUCH WEAKER AND THE QUARKS AND GLUONS BEHAVE ALMOST LIKE FREE PARTICLES SHOWS A PHOTOGRAPH OF A COLLISION BETWEEN A HIGHENERGY PROTON AND ANTIPROTON THE SUCCESS OF THE UNIFICATION OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC AND WEAK NUCLEAR FORCES LED TO A NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS TO COMBINE THESE TWO FORCES WITH THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE INTO WHAT IS CALLED A GRAND UNIFIED THEORY OR GUT THIS TITLE IS RATHER AN EXAGGERATION THE RESULTANT THEORIES ARE NOT ALL THAT GRAND NOR ARE THEY FULLY UNIFIED AS THEY DO NOT INCLUDE GRAVITY NOR ARE THEY REALLY COMPLETE THEORIES BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN A NUMBER OF PARAMETERS WHOSE VALUES CANNOT BE PREDICTED FROM THE THEORY BUT HAVE TO BE CHOSEN TO FIT IN WITH EXPERIMENT NEVERTHELESS THEY MAY BE A STEP TOWARD A COMPLETE FULLY UNIFIED THEORY THE BASIC IDEA OF GUTS IS AS FOLLOWS AS WAS MENTIONED ABOVE THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE GETS WEAKER AT HIGH ENERGIES ON THE OTHER HAND THE ELECTROMAGNETIC AND WEAK FORCES WHICH ARE NOT ASYMPTOTICALLY FREE GET STRONGER AT HIGH ENERGIES AT SOME VERY HIGH ENERGY CALLED THE GRAND UNIFICATION ENERGY THESE THREE FORCES WOULD ALL HAVE THE SAME STRENGTH AND SO COULD JUST BE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF A SINGLE FORCE THE GUTS ALSO PREDICT THAT AT THIS ENERGY THE DIFFERENT SPIN MATTER PARTICLES LIKE QUARKS AND ELECTRONS WOULD ALSO ALL BE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THUS ACHIEVING ANOTHER UNIFICATION THE VALUE OF THE GRAND UNIFICATION ENERGY IS NOT VERY WELL KNOWN BUT IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO BE AT LEAST A THOUSAND MILLION MILLION GEV THE PRESENT GENERATION OF PARTICLE ACCELERATORS CAN COLLIDE PARTICLES AT ENERGIES OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED GEV AND MACHINES ARE PLANNED THAT WOULD RAISE THIS TO A FEW THOUSAND GEV BUT A MACHINE THAT WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ACCELERATE PARTICLES TO THE GRAND UNIFICATION ENERGY WOULD HAVE TO BE AS BIG AS THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO BE FUNDED IN THE PRESENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE THUS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TEST GRAND UNIFIED THEORIES DIRECTLY IN THE LABORATORY HOWEVER JUST AS IN THE CASE OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC AND WEAK UNIFIED THEORY THERE ARE LOWENERGY CONSEQUENCES OF THE THEORY THAT CAN BE TESTED THE MOST INTERESTING OF THESE IS THE PREDICTION THAT PROTONS WHICH MAKE UP MUCH OF THE MASS OF ORDINARY MATTER CAN SPONTANEOUSLY DECAY INTO LIGHTER PARTICLES SUCH AS ANTIELECTRONS THE REASON THIS IS POSSIBLE IS THAT AT THE GRAND UNIFICATION ENERGY THERE IS NO ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A QUARK AND AN ANTIELECTRON THE THREE QUARKS INSIDE A PROTON NORMALLY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO CHANGE INTO ANTIELECTRONS BUT VERY OCCASIONALLY ONE OF THEM MAY ACQUIRE SUFFICIENT ENERGY TO MAKE THE TRANSITION BECAUSE THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE MEANS THAT THE ENERGY OF THE QUARKS INSIDE THE PROTON CANNOT BE FIXED EXACTLY THE PROTON WOULD THEN DECAY THE PROBABILITY OF A QUARK GAINING SUFFICIENT ENERGY IS SO LOW THAT ONE IS LIKELY TO HAVE TO WAIT AT LEAST A MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION YEARS FOLLOWED BY THIRTY ZEROS THIS IS MUCH LONGER THAN THE TIME SINCE THE BIG BANG WHICH IS A MERE TEN THOUSAND MILLION YEARS OR SO FOLLOWED BY TEN ZEROS THUS ONE MIGHT THINK THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF SPONTANEOUS PROTON DECAY COULD NOT BE TESTED EXPERIMENTALLY HOWEVER ONE CAN INCREASE ONES CHANCES OF DETECTING A DECAY BY OBSERVING A LARGE AMOUNT OF MATTER CONTAINING A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PROTONS IF FOR EXAMPLE ONE OBSERVED A NUMBER OF PROTONS EQUAL TO FOLLOWED BY THIRTYONE ZEROS FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR ONE WOULD EXPECT ACCORDING TO THE SIMPLEST GUT TO OBSERVE MORE THAN ONE PROTON DECAY A NUMBER OF SUCH EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BUT NONE HAVE YIELDED DEFINITE EVIDENCE OF PROTON OR NEUTRON DECAY ONE EXPERIMENT USED EIGHT THOUSAND TONS OF WATER AND WAS PERFORMED IN THE MORTON SALT MINE IN OHIO TO AVOID OTHER EVENTS TAKING PLACE CAUSED BY COSMIC RAYS THAT MIGHT BE CONFUSED WITH PROTON DECAY SINCE NO SPONTANEOUS PROTON DECAY HAD BEEN OBSERVED DURING THE EXPERIMENT ONE CAN CALCULATE THAT THE PROBABLE LIFE OF THE PROTON MUST BE GREATER THAN TEN MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION YEARS WITH THIRTYONE ZEROS THIS IS LONGER THAN THE LIFETIME PREDICTED BY THE SIMPLEST GRAND UNIFIED THEORY BUT THERE ARE MORE ELABORATE THEORIES IN WHICH THE PREDICTED LIFETIMES ARE LONGER STILL MORE SENSITIVE EXPERIMENTS INVOLVING EVEN LARGER QUANTITIES OF MATTER WILL BE NEEDED TO TEST THEM EVEN THOUGH IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO OBSERVE SPONTANEOUS PROTON DECAY IT MAY BE THAT OUR VERY EXISTENCE IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE REVERSE PROCESS THE PRODUCTION OF PROTONS OR MORE SIMPLY OF QUARKS FROM AN INITIAL SITUATION IN WHICH THERE WERE NO MORE QUARKS THAN ANTIQUARKS WHICH IS THE MOST NATURAL WAY TO IMAGINE THE UNIVERSE STARTING OUT MATTER ON THE EARTH IS MADE UP MAINLY OF PROTONS AND NEUTRONS WHICH IN TURN ARE MADE UP OF QUARKS THERE ARE NO ANTIPROTONS OR ANTINEUTRONS MADE UP FROM ANTIQUARKS EXCEPT FOR A FEW THAT PHYSICISTS PRODUCE IN LARGE PARTICLE ACCELERATORS WE HAVE EVIDENCE FROM COSMIC RAYS THAT THE SAME IS TRUE FOR ALL THE MATTER IN OUR GALAXY THERE ARE NO ANTIPROTONS OR ANTINEUTRONS APART FROM A SMALL NUMBER THAT ARE PRODUCED AS PARTICLE ANTIPARTICLE PAIRS IN HIGHENERGY COLLISIONS IF THERE WERE LARGE REGIONS OF ANTIMATTER IN OUR GALAXY WE WOULD EXPECT TO OBSERVE LARGE QUANTITIES OF RADIATION FROM THE BORDERS BETWEEN THE REGIONS OF MATTER AND ANTIMATTER WHERE MANY PARTICLES WOULD BE COLLIDING WITH THEIR ANTIPARTICLES ANNIHILATING EACH OTHER AND GIVING OFF HIGHENERGY RADIATION WE HAVE NO DIRECT EVIDENCE AS TO WHETHER THE MATTER IN OTHER GALAXIES IS MADE UP OF PROTONS AND NEUTRONS OR ANTIPROTONS AND ANTINEUTRONS BUT IT MUST BE ONE OR THE OTHER THERE CANNOT BE A MIXTURE IN A SINGLE GALAXY BECAUSE IN THAT CASE WE WOULD AGAIN OBSERVE A LOT OF RADIATION FROM ANNIHILATIONS WE THEREFORE BELIEVE THAT ALL GALAXIES ARE COMPOSED OF QUARKS RATHER THAN ANTIQUARKS IT SEEMS IMPLAUSIBLE THAT SOME GALAXIES SHOULD BE MATTER AND SOME ANTIMATTER WHY SHOULD THERE BE SO MANY MORE QUARKS THAN ANTIQUARKS WHY ARE THERE NOT EQUAL NUMBERS OF EACH IT IS CERTAINLY FORTUNATE FOR US THAT THE NUMBERS ARE UNEQUAL BECAUSE IF THEY HAD BEEN THE SAME NEARLY ALL THE QUARKS AND ANTIQUARKS WOULD HAVE ANNIHILATED EACH OTHER IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE AND LEFT A UNIVERSE FILLED WITH RADIATION BUT HARDLY ANY MATTER THERE WOULD THEN HAVE BEEN NO GALAXIES STARS OR PLANETS ON WHICH HUMAN LIFE COULD HAVE DEVELOPED LUCKILY GRAND UNIFIED THEORIES MAY PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION OF WHY THE UNIVERSE SHOULD NOW CONTAIN MORE QUARKS THAN ANTIQUARKS EVEN IF IT STARTED OUT WITH EQUAL NUMBERS OF EACH AS WE HAVE SEEN GUTS ALLOW QUARKS TO CHANGE INTO ANTIELECTRONS AT HIGH ENERGY THEY ALSO ALLOW THE REVERSE PROCESSES ANTIQUARKS TURNING INTO ELECTRONS AND ELECTRONS AND ANTIELECTRONS TURNING INTO ANTIQUARKS AND QUARKS THERE WAS A TIME IN THE VERY EARLY UNIVERSE WHEN IT WAS SO HOT THAT THE PARTICLE ENERGIES WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGH ENOUGH FOR THESE TRANSFORMATIONS TO TAKE PLACE BUT WHY SHOULD THAT LEAD TO MORE QUARKS THAN ANTIQUARKS THE REASON IS THAT THE LAWS OF PHYSICS ARE NOT QUITE THE SAME FOR PARTICLES AND ANTIPARTICLES UP TO IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE LAWS OF PHYSICS OBEYED EACH OF THREE SEPARATE SYMMETRIES CALLED C P AND T THE SYMMETRY C MEANS THAT THE LAWS ARE THE SAME FOR PARTICLES AND ANTIPARTICLES THE SYMMETRY P MEANS THAT THE LAWS ARE THE SAME FOR ANY SITUATION AND ITS MIRROR IMAGE THE MIRROR IMAGE OF A PARTICLE SPINNING IN A RIGHTHANDED DIRECTION IS ONE SPINNING IN A LEFTHANDED DIRECTION THE SYMMETRY T MEANS THAT IF YOU REVERSE THE DIRECTION OF MOTION OF ALL PARTICLES AND ANTIPARTICLES THE SYSTEM SHOULD GO BACK TO WHAT IT WAS AT EARLIER TIMES IN OTHER WORDS THE LAWS ARE THE SAME IN THE FORWARD AND BACKWARD DIRECTIONS OF TIME IN TWO AMERICAN PHYSICISTS TSUNGDAO LEE AND CHEN NING YANG SUGGESTED THAT THE WEAK FORCE DOES NOT IN FACT OBEY THE SYMMETRY P IN OTHER WORDS THE WEAK FORCE WOULD MAKE THE UNIVERSE DEVELOP IN A DIFFERENT WAY FROM THE WAY IN WHICH THE MIRROR IMAGE OF THE UNIVERSE WOULD DEVELOP THE SAME YEAR A COLLEAGUE CHIENSHIUNG WU PROVED THEIR PREDICTION CORRECT SHE DID THIS BY LINING UP THE NUCLEI OF RADIOACTIVE ATOMS IN A MAGNETIC FIELD SO THAT THEY WERE ALL SPINNING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND SHOWED THAT THE ELECTRONS WERE GIVEN OFF MORE IN ONE DIRECTION THAN ANOTHER THE FOLLOWING YEAR LEE AND YANG RECEIVED THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR THEIR IDEA IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT THE WEAK FORCE DID NOT OBEY THE SYMMETRY C THAT IS IT WOULD CAUSE A UNIVERSE COMPOSED OF ANTIPARTICLES TO BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY FROM OUR UNIVERSE NEVERTHELESS IT SEEMED THAT THE WEAK FORCE DID OBEY THE COMBINED SYMMETRY CP THAT IS THE UNIVERSE WOULD DEVELOP IN THE SAME WAY AS ITS MIRROR IMAGE IF IN ADDITION EVERY PARTICLE WAS SWAPPED WITH ITS ANTIPARTICLE HOWEVER IN TWO MORE AMERICANS J W CRONIN AND VAL FITCH DISCOVERED THAT EVEN THE CP SYMMETRY WAS NOT OBEYED IN THE DECAY OF CERTAIN PARTICLES CALLED KMESONS CRONIN AND FITCH EVENTUALLY RECEIVED THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR THEIR WORK IN A LOT OF PRIZES HAVE BEEN AWARDED FOR SHOWING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS WE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THERE IS A MATHEMATICAL THEOREM THAT SAYS THAT ANY THEORY THAT OBEYS QUANTUM MECHANICS AND RELATIVITY MUST ALWAYS OBEY THE COMBINED SYMMETRY CPT IN OTHER WORDS THE UNIVERSE WOULD HAVE TO BEHAVE THE SAME IF ONE REPLACED PARTICLES BY ANTIPARTICLES TOOK THE MIRROR IMAGE AND ALSO REVERSED THE DIRECTION OF TIME BUT CRONIN AND FITCH SHOWED THAT IF ONE REPLACES PARTICLES BY ANTIPARTICLES AND TAKES THE MIRROR IMAGE BUT DOES NOT REVERSE THE DIRECTION OF TIME THEN THE UNIVERSE DOES NOT BEHAVE THE SAME THE LAWS OF PHYSICS THEREFORE MUST CHANGE IF ONE REVERSES THE DIRECTION OF TIME  THEY DO NOT OBEY THE SYMMETRY T CERTAINLY THE EARLY UNIVERSE DOES NOT OBEY THE SYMMETRY T AS TIME RUNS FORWARD THE UNIVERSE EXPANDS IF IT RAN BACKWARD THE UNIVERSE WOULD BE CONTRACTING AND SINCE THERE ARE FORCES THAT DO NOT OBEY THE SYMMETRY T IT FOLLOWS THAT AS THE UNIVERSE EXPANDS THESE FORCES COULD CAUSE MORE ANTIELECTRONS TO TURN INTO QUARKS THAN ELECTRONS INTO ANTIQUARKS THEN AS THE UNIVERSE EXPANDED AND COOLED THE ANTIQUARKS WOULD ANNIHILATE WITH THE QUARKS BUT SINCE THERE WOULD BE MORE QUARKS THAN ANTIQUARKS A SMALL EXCESS OF QUARKS WOULD REMAIN IT IS THESE THAT MAKE UP THE MATTER WE SEE TODAY AND OUT OF WHICH WE OURSELVES ARE MADE THUS OUR VERY EXISTENCE COULD BE REGARDED AS A CONFIRMATION OF GRAND UNIFIED THEORIES THOUGH A QUALITATIVE ONE ONLY THE UNCERTAINTIES ARE SUCH THAT ONE CANNOT PREDICT THE NUMBERS OF QUARKS THAT WILL BE LEFT AFTER THE ANNIHILATION OR EVEN WHETHER IT WOULD BE QUARKS OR ANTIQUARKS THAT WOULD REMAIN HAD IT BEEN AN EXCESS OF ANTIQUARKS HOWEVER WE WOULD SIMPLY HAVE NAMED ANTIQUARKS QUARKS AND QUARKS ANTIQUARKS GRAND UNIFIED THEORIES DO NOT INCLUDE THE FORCE OF GRAVITY THIS DOES NOT MATTER TOO MUCH BECAUSE GRAVITY IS SUCH A WEAK FORCE THAT ITS EFFECTS CAN USUALLY BE NEGLECTED WHEN WE ARE DEALING WITH ELEMENTARY PARTICLES OR ATOMS HOWEVER THE FACT THAT IT IS BOTH LONG RANGE AND ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE MEANS THAT ITS EFFECTS ALL ADD UP SO FOR A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE NUMBER OF MATTER PARTICLES GRAVITATIONAL FORCES CAN DOMINATE OVER ALL OTHER FORCES THIS IS WHY IT IS GRAVITY THAT DETERMINES THE EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE EVEN FOR OBJECTS THE SIZE OF STARS THE ATTRACTIVE FORCE OF GRAVITY CAN WIN OVER ALL THE OTHER FORCES AND CAUSE THE STAR TO COLLAPSE MY WORK IN THE S FOCUSED ON THE BLACK HOLES THAT CAN RESULT FROM SUCH STELLAR COLLAPSE AND THE INTENSE GRAVITATIONAL FIELDS AROUND THEM IT WAS THIS THAT LED TO THE FIRST HINTS OF HOW THE THEORIES OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND GENERAL RELATIVITY MIGHT AFFECT EACH OTHER A GLIMPSE OF THE SHAPE OF A QUANTUM THEORY OF GRAVITY YET TO COME THE TERM BLACK HOLE IS OF VERY RECENT ORIGIN IT WAS COINED IN BY THE AMERICAN SCIENTIST JOHN WHEELER AS A GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF AN IDEA THAT GOES BACK AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED YEARS TO A TIME WHEN THERE WERE TWO THEORIES ABOUT LIGHT ONE WHICH NEWTON FAVORED WAS THAT IT WAS COMPOSED OF PARTICLES THE OTHER WAS THAT IT WAS MADE OF WAVES WE NOW KNOW THAT REALLY BOTH THEORIES ARE CORRECT BY THE WAVEPARTICLE DUALITY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS LIGHT CAN BE REGARDED AS BOTH A WAVE AND A PARTICLE UNDER THE THEORY THAT LIGHT IS MADE UP OF WAVES IT WAS NOT CLEAR HOW IT WOULD RESPOND TO GRAVITY BUT IF LIGHT IS COMPOSED OF PARTICLES ONE MIGHT EXPECT THEM TO BE AFFECTED BY GRAVITY IN THE SAME WAY THAT CANNONBALLS ROCKETS AND PLANETS ARE AT FIRST PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT PARTICLES OF LIGHT TRAVELED INFINITELY FAST SO GRAVITY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SLOW THEM DOWN BUT THE DISCOVERY BY ROEMER THAT LIGHT TRAVELS AT A FINITE SPEED MEANT THAT GRAVITY MIGHT HAVE AN IMPORTANT EFFECT ON THIS ASSUMPTION A CAMBRIDGE DON JOHN MICHELL WROTE A PAPER IN IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON IN WHICH HE POINTED OUT THAT A STAR THAT WAS SUFFICIENTLY MASSIVE AND COMPACT WOULD HAVE SUCH A STRONG GRAVITATIONAL FIELD THAT LIGHT COULD NOT ESCAPE ANY LIGHT EMITTED FROM THE SURFACE OF THE STAR WOULD BE DRAGGED BACK BY THE STARS GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION BEFORE IT COULD GET VERY FAR MICHELL SUGGESTED THAT THERE MIGHT BE A LARGE NUMBER OF STARS LIKE THIS ALTHOUGH WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE THEM BECAUSE THE LIGHT FROM THEM WOULD NOT REACH US WE WOULD STILL FEEL THEIR GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION SUCH OBJECTS ARE WHAT WE NOW CALL BLACK HOLES BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE BLACK VOIDS IN SPACE A SIMILAR SUGGESTION WAS MADE A FEW YEARS LATER BY THE FRENCH SCIENTIST THE MARQUIS DE LAPLACE APPARENTLY INDEPENDENTLY OF MICHELL INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH LAPLACE INCLUDED IT IN ONLY THE FIRST AND SECOND EDITIONS OF HIS BOOK THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD AND LEFT IT OUT OF LATER EDITIONS PERHAPS HE DECIDED THAT IT WAS A CRAZY IDEA ALSO THE PARTICLE THEORY OF LIGHT WENT OUT OF FAVOR DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT SEEMED THAT EVERYTHING COULD BE EXPLAINED BY THE WAVE THEORY AND ACCORDING TO THE WAVE THEORY IT WAS NOT CLEAR THAT LIGHT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY GRAVITY AT ALL IN FACT IT IS NOT REALLY CONSISTENT TO TREAT LIGHT LIKE CANNONBALLS IN NEWTONS THEORY OF GRAVITY BECAUSE THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS FIXED A CANNONBALL FIRED UPWARD FROM THE EARTH WILL BE SLOWED DOWN BY GRAVITY AND WILL EVENTUALLY STOP AND FALL BACK A PHOTON HOWEVER MUST CONTINUE UPWARD AT A CONSTANT SPEED HOW THEN CAN NEWTONIAN GRAVITY AFFECT LIGHT A CONSISTENT THEORY OF HOW GRAVITY AFFECTS LIGHT DID NOT COME ALONG UNTIL EINSTEIN PROPOSED GENERAL RELATIVITY IN AND EVEN THEN IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE THEORY FOR MASSIVE STARS WERE UNDERSTOOD TO UNDERSTAND HOW A BLACK HOLE MIGHT BE FORMED WE FIRST NEED AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIFE CYCLE OF A STAR A STAR IS FORMED WHEN A LARGE AMOUNT OF GAS MOSTLY HYDROGEN STARTS TO COLLAPSE IN ON ITSELF DUE TO ITS GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION AS IT CONTRACTS THE ATOMS OF THE GAS COLLIDE WITH EACH OTHER MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY AND AT GREATER AND GREATER SPEEDS  THE GAS HEATS UP EVENTUALLY THE GAS WILL BE SO HOT THAT WHEN THE HYDROGEN ATOMS COLLIDE THEY NO LONGER BOUNCE OFF EACH OTHER BUT INSTEAD COALESCE TO FORM HELIUM THE HEAT RELEASED IN THIS REACTION WHICH IS LIKE A CONTROLLED HYDROGEN BOMB EXPLOSION IS WHAT MAKES THE STAR SHINE THIS ADDITIONAL HEAT ALSO INCREASES THE PRESSURE OF THE GAS UNTIL IT IS SUFFICIENT TO BALANCE THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION AND THE GAS STOPS CONTRACTING IT IS A BIT LIKE A BALLOON THERE IS A BALANCE BETWEEN THE PRESSURE OF THE AIR INSIDE WHICH IS TRYING TO MAKE THE BALLOON EXPAND AND THE TENSION IN THE RUBBER WHICH IS TRYING TO MAKE THE BALLOON SMALLER STARS WILL REMAIN STABLE LIKE THIS FOR A LONG TIME WITH HEAT FROM THE NUCLEAR REACTIONS BALANCING THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION EVENTUALLY HOWEVER THE STAR WILL RUN OUT OF ITS HYDROGEN AND OTHER NUCLEAR FUELS PARADOXICALLY THE MORE FUEL A STAR STARTS OFF WITH THE SOONER IT RUNS OUT THIS IS BECAUSE THE MORE MASSIVE THE STAR IS THE HOTTER IT NEEDS TO BE TO BALANCE ITS GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION AND THE HOTTER IT IS THE FASTER IT WILL USE UP ITS FUEL OUR SUN HAS PROBABLY GOT ENOUGH FUEL FOR ANOTHER FIVE THOUSAND MILLION YEARS OR SO BUT MORE MASSIVE STARS CAN USE UP THEIR FUEL IN AS LITTLE AS ONE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS MUCH LESS THAN THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE WHEN A STAR RUNS OUT OF FUEL IT STARTS TO COOL OFF AND SO TO CONTRACT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO IT THEN WAS FIRST UNDERSTOOD ONLY AT THE END OF THE S IN AN INDIAN GRADUATE STUDENT SUBRAHMANYAN CHANDRASEKHAR SET SAIL FOR ENGLAND TO STUDY AT CAMBRIDGE WITH THE BRITISH ASTRONOMER SIR ARTHUR EDDINGTON AN EXPERT ON GENERAL RELATIVITY ACCORDING TO SOME ACCOUNTS A JOURNALIST TOLD EDDINGTON IN THE EARLY S THAT HE HAD HEARD THERE WERE ONLY THREE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO UNDERSTOOD GENERAL RELATIVITY EDDINGTON PAUSED THEN REPLIED I AM TRYING TO THINK WHO THE THIRD PERSON IS DURING HIS VOYAGE FROM INDIA CHANDRASEKHAR WORKED OUT HOW BIG A STAR COULD BE AND STILL SUPPORT ITSELF AGAINST ITS OWN GRAVITY AFTER IT HAD USED UP ALL ITS FUEL THE IDEA WAS THIS WHEN THE STAR BECOMES SMALL THE MATTER PARTICLES GET VERY NEAR EACH OTHER AND SO ACCORDING TO THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE THEY MUST HAVE VERY DIFFERENT VELOCITIES THIS MAKES THEM MOVE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER AND SO TENDS TO MAKE THE STAR EXPAND A STAR CAN THEREFORE MAINTAIN ITSELF AT A CONSTANT RADIUS BY A BALANCE BETWEEN THE ATTRACTION OF GRAVITY AND THE REPULSION THAT ARISES FROM THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE JUST AS EARLIER IN ITS LIFE CHANDRASEKHAR REALIZED HOWEVER THAT THERE IS A LIMIT TO THE REPULSION THAT THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE CAN PROVIDE THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY LIMITS THE MAXIMUM DIFFERENCE IN THE VELOCITIES OF THE MATTER PARTICLES IN THE STAR TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT THIS MEANS THAT WHEN THE STAR GOT SUFFICIENTLY DENSE THE REPULSION CAUSED BY THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE WOULD BE LESS THAN THE ATTRACTION OF GRAVITY CHANDRASEKHAR CALCULATED THAT A COLD STAR OF MORE THAN ABOUT ONE AND A HALF TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT ITSELF AGAINST ITS OWN GRAVITY THIS MASS IS NOW KNOWN AS THE CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT A SIMILAR DISCOVERY WAS MADE ABOUT THE SAME TIME BY THE RUSSIAN SCIENTIST LEV DAVIDOVICH LANDAU THIS HAD SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ULTIMATE FATE OF MASSIVE STARS IF A STARS MASS IS LESS THAN THE CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT IT CAN EVENTUALLY STOP CONTRACTING AND SETTLE DOWN TO A POSSIBLE FINAL STATE AS A WHITE DWARF WITH A RADIUS OF A FEW THOUSAND MILES AND A DENSITY OF HUNDREDS OF TONS PER CUBIC INCH A WHITE DWARF IS SUPPORTED BY THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE REPULSION BETWEEN THE ELECTRONS IN ITS MATTER WE OBSERVE A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE WHITE DWARF STARS ONE OF THE FIRST TO BE DISCOVERED IS A STAR THAT IS ORBITING AROUND SIRIUS THE BRIGHTEST STAR IN THE NIGHT SKY LANDAU POINTED OUT THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER POSSIBLE FINAL STATE FOR A STAR ALSO WITH A LIMITING MASS OF ABOUT ONE OR TWO TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN BUT MUCH SMALLER EVEN THAN A WHITE DWARF THESE STARS WOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE REPULSION BETWEEN NEUTRONS AND PROTONS RATHER THAN BETWEEN ELECTRONS THEY WERE THEREFORE CALLED NEUTRON STARS THEY WOULD HAVE A RADIUS OF ONLY TEN MILES OR SO AND A DENSITY OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TONS PER CUBIC INCH AT THE TIME THEY WERE FIRST PREDICTED THERE WAS NO WAY THAT NEUTRON STARS COULD BE OBSERVED THEY WERE NOT ACTUALLY DETECTED UNTIL MUCH LATER STARS WITH MASSES ABOVE THE CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WHEN THEY COME TO THE END OF THEIR FUEL IN SOME CASES THEY MAY EXPLODE OR MANAGE TO THROW OFF ENOUGH MATTER TO REDUCE THEIR MASS BELOW THE LIMIT AND SO AVOID CATASTROPHIC GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THIS ALWAYS HAPPENED NO MATTER HOW BIG THE STAR HOW WOULD IT KNOW THAT IT HAD TO LOSE WEIGHT AND EVEN IF EVERY STAR MANAGED TO LOSE ENOUGH MASS TO AVOID COLLAPSE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU ADDED MORE MASS TO A WHITE DWARF OR NEUTRON STAR TO TAKE IT OVER THE LIMIT WOULD IT COLLAPSE TO INFINITE DENSITY EDDINGTON WAS SHOCKED BY THAT IMPLICATION AND HE REFUSED TO BELIEVE CHANDRASEKHARS RESULT EDDINGTON THOUGHT IT WAS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE THAT A STAR COULD COLLAPSE TO A POINT THIS WAS THE VIEW OF MOST SCIENTISTS EINSTEIN HIMSELF WROTE A PAPER IN WHICH HE CLAIMED THAT STARS WOULD NOT SHRINK TO ZERO SIZE THE HOSTILITY OF OTHER SCIENTISTS PARTICULARLY EDDINGTON HIS FORMER TEACHER AND THE LEADING AUTHORITY ON THE STRUCTURE OF STARS PERSUADED CHANDRASEKHAR TO ABANDON THIS LINE OF WORK AND TURN INSTEAD TO OTHER PROBLEMS IN ASTRONOMY SUCH AS THE MOTION OF STAR CLUSTERS HOWEVER WHEN HE WAS AWARDED THE NOBEL PRIZE IN IT WAS AT LEAST IN PART FOR HIS EARLY WORK ON THE LIMITING MASS OF COLD STARS CHANDRASEKHAR HAD SHOWN THAT THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE COULD NOT HALT THE COLLAPSE OF A STAR MORE MASSIVE THAN THE CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT BUT THE PROBLEM OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO SUCH A STAR ACCORDING TO GENERAL RELATIVITY WAS FIRST SOLVED BY A YOUNG AMERICAN ROBERT OPPENHEIMER IN HIS RESULT HOWEVER SUGGESTED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO OBSERVATIONAL CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD BE DETECTED BY THE TELESCOPES OF THE DAY THEN WORLD WAR II INTERVENED AND OPPENHEIMER HIMSELF BECAME CLOSELY INVOLVED IN THE ATOM BOMB PROJECT AFTER THE WAR THE PROBLEM OF GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE WAS LARGELY FORGOTTEN AS MOST SCIENTISTS BECAME CAUGHT UP IN WHAT HAPPENS ON THE SCALE OF THE ATOM AND ITS NUCLEUS IN THE S HOWEVER INTEREST IN THE LARGESCALE PROBLEMS OF ASTRONOMY AND COSMOLOGY WAS REVIVED BY A GREAT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER AND RANGE OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE APPLICATION OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY OPPENHEIMERS WORK WAS THEN REDISCOVERED AND EXTENDED BY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE PICTURE THAT WE NOW HAVE FROM OPPENHEIMERS WORK IS AS FOLLOWS THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD OF THE STAR CHANGES THE PATHS OF LIGHT RAYS IN SPACETIME FROM WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THE STAR NOT BEEN PRESENT THE LIGHT CONES WHICH INDICATE THE PATHS FOLLOWED IN SPACE AND TIME BY FLASHES OF LIGHT EMITTED FROM THEIR TIPS ARE BENT SLIGHTLY INWARD NEAR THE SURFACE OF THE STAR THIS CAN BE SEEN IN THE BENDING OF LIGHT FROM DISTANT STARS OBSERVED DURING AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN AS THE STAR CONTRACTS THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD AT ITS SURFACE GETS STRONGER AND THE LIGHT CONES GET BENT INWARD MORE THIS MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR LIGHT FROM THE STAR TO ESCAPE AND THE LIGHT APPEARS DIMMER AND REDDER TO AN OBSERVER AT A DISTANCE EVENTUALLY WHEN THE STAR HAS SHRUNK TO A CERTAIN CRITICAL RADIUS THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD AT THE SURFACE BECOMES SO STRONG THAT THE LIGHT CONES ARE BENT INWARD SO MUCH THAT LIGHT CAN NO LONGER ESCAPE ACCORDING TO THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY NOTHING CAN TRAVEL FASTER THAN LIGHT THUS IF LIGHT CANNOT ESCAPE NEITHER CAN ANYTHING ELSE EVERYTHING IS DRAGGED BACK BY THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD SO ONE HAS A SET OF EVENTS A REGION OF SPACETIME FROM WHICH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESCAPE TO REACH A DISTANT OBSERVER THIS REGION IS WHAT WE NOW CALL A BLACK HOLE ITS BOUNDARY IS CALLED THE EVENT HORIZON AND IT COINCIDES WITH THE PATHS OF LIGHT RAYS THAT JUST FAIL TO ESCAPE FROM THE BLACK HOLE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IF YOU WERE WATCHING A STAR COLLAPSE TO FORM A BLACK HOLE ONE HAS TO REMEMBER THAT IN THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE TIME EACH OBSERVER HAS HIS OWN MEASURE OF TIME THE TIME FOR SOMEONE ON A STAR WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT FOR SOMEONE AT A DISTANCE BECAUSE OF THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD OF THE STAR SUPPOSE AN INTREPID ASTRONAUT ON THE SURFACE OF THE COLLAPSING STAR COLLAPSING INWARD WITH IT SENT A SIGNAL EVERY SECOND ACCORDING TO HIS WATCH TO HIS SPACESHIP ORBITING ABOUT THE STAR AT SOME TIME ON HIS WATCH SAY THE STAR WOULD SHRINK BELOW THE CRITICAL RADIUS AT WHICH THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD BECOMES SO STRONG NOTHING CAN ESCAPE AND HIS SIGNALS WOULD NO LONGER REACH THE SPACESHIP AS APPROACHED HIS COMPANIONS WATCHING FROM THE SPACESHIP WOULD FIND THE INTERVALS BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE SIGNALS FROM THE ASTRONAUT GETTING LONGER AND LONGER BUT THIS EFFECT WOULD BE VERY SMALL BEFORE THEY WOULD HAVE TO WAIT ONLY VERY SLIGHTLY MORE THAN A SECOND BETWEEN THE ASTRONAUTS  SIGNAL AND THE ONE THAT HE SENT WHEN HIS WATCH READ BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOREVER FOR THE SIGNAL THE LIGHT WAVES EMITTED FROM THE SURFACE OF THE STAR BETWEEN AND BY THE ASTRONAUTS WATCH WOULD BE SPREAD OUT OVER AN INFINITE PERIOD OF TIME AS SEEN FROM THE SPACESHIP THE TIME INTERVAL BETWEEN THE ARRIVAL OF SUCCESSIVE WAVES AT THE SPACESHIP WOULD GET LONGER AND LONGER SO THE LIGHT FROM THE STAR WOULD APPEAR REDDER AND REDDER AND FAINTER AND FAINTER EVENTUALLY THE STAR WOULD BE SO DIM THAT IT COULD NO LONGER BE SEEN FROM THE SPACESHIP ALL THAT WOULD BE LEFT WOULD BE A BLACK HOLE IN SPACE THE STAR WOULD HOWEVER CONTINUE TO EXERT THE SAME GRAVITATIONAL FORCE ON THE SPACESHIP WHICH WOULD CONTINUE TO ORBIT THE BLACK HOLE THIS SCENARIO IS NOT ENTIRELY REALISTIC HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEM GRAVITY GETS WEAKER THE FARTHER YOU ARE FROM THE STAR SO THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE ON OUR INTREPID ASTRONAUTS FEET WOULD ALWAYS BE GREATER THAN THE FORCE ON HIS HEAD THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE FORCES WOULD STRETCH OUR ASTRONAUT OUT LIKE SPAGHETTI OR TEAR HIM APART BEFORE THE STAR HAD CONTRACTED TO THE CRITICAL RADIUS AT WHICH THE EVENT HORIZON FORMED HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MUCH LARGER OBJECTS IN THE UNIVERSE LIKE THE CENTRAL REGIONS OF GALAXIES THAT CAN ALSO UNDERGO GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE TO PRODUCE BLACK HOLES AN ASTRONAUT ON ONE OF THESE WOULD NOT BE TORN APART BEFORE THE BLACK HOLE FORMED HE WOULD NOT IN FACT FEEL ANYTHING SPECIAL AS HE REACHED THE CRITICAL RADIUS AND COULD PASS THE POINT OF NO RETURN WITHOUT NOTICING IT HOWEVER WITHIN JUST A FEW HOURS AS THE REGION CONTINUED TO COLLAPSE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCES ON HIS HEAD AND HIS FEET WOULD BECOME SO STRONG THAT AGAIN IT WOULD TEAR HIM APART THE WORK THAT ROGER PENROSE AND I DID BETWEEN AND SHOWED THAT ACCORDING TO GENERAL RELATIVITY THERE MUST BE A SINGULARITY OF INFINITE DENSITY AND SPACETIME CURVATURE WITHIN A BLACK HOLE THIS IS RATHER LIKE THE BIG BANG AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME ONLY IT WOULD BE AN END OF TIME FOR THE COLLAPSING BODY AND THE ASTRONAUT AT THIS SINGULARITY THE LAWS OF SCIENCE AND OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT THE FUTURE WOULD BREAK DOWN HOWEVER ANY OBSERVER WHO REMAINED OUTSIDE THE BLACK HOLE WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS FAILURE OF PREDICTABILITY BECAUSE NEITHER LIGHT NOR ANY OTHER SIGNAL COULD REACH HIM FROM THE SINGULARITY THIS REMARKABLE FACT LED ROGER PENROSE TO PROPOSE THE COSMIC CENSORSHIP HYPOTHESIS WHICH MIGHT BE PARAPHRASED AS GOD ABHORS A NAKED SINGULARITY IN OTHER WORDS THE SINGULARITIES PRODUCED BY GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OCCUR ONLY IN PLACES LIKE BLACK HOLES WHERE THEY ARE DECENTLY HIDDEN FROM OUTSIDE VIEW BY AN EVENT HORIZON STRICTLY THIS IS WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE WEAK COSMIC CENSORSHIP HYPOTHESIS IT PROTECTS OBSERVERS WHO REMAIN OUTSIDE THE BLACK HOLE FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BREAKDOWN OF PREDICTABILITY THAT OCCURS AT THE SINGULARITY BUT IT DOES NOTHING AT ALL FOR THE POOR UNFORTUNATE ASTRONAUT WHO FALLS INTO THE HOLE THERE ARE SOME SOLUTIONS OF THE EQUATIONS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY IN WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE FOR OUR ASTRONAUT TO SEE A NAKED SINGULARITY HE MAY BE ABLE TO AVOID HITTING THE SINGULARITY AND INSTEAD FALL THROUGH A WORMHOLE AND COME OUT IN ANOTHER REGION OF THE UNIVERSE THIS WOULD OFFER GREAT POSSIBILITIES FOR TRAVEL IN SPACE AND TIME BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT SEEMS THAT THESE SOLUTIONS MAY ALL BE HIGHLY UNSTABLE THE LEAST DISTURBANCE SUCH AS THE PRESENCE OF AN ASTRONAUT MAY CHANGE THEM SO THAT THE ASTRONAUT COULD NOT SEE THE SINGULARITY UNTIL HE HIT IT AND HIS TIME CAME TO AN END IN OTHER WORDS THE SINGULARITY WOULD ALWAYS LIE IN HIS FUTURE AND NEVER IN HIS PAST THE STRONG VERSION OF THE COSMIC CENSORSHIP HYPOTHESIS STATES THAT IN A REALISTIC SOLUTION THE SINGULARITIES WOULD ALWAYS LIE EITHER ENTIRELY IN THE FUTURE LIKE THE SINGULARITIES OF GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OR ENTIRELY IN THE PAST LIKE THE BIG BANG I STRONGLY BELIEVE IN COSMIC CENSORSHIP SO I BET KIP THORNE AND JOHN PRESKILL OF CAL TECH THAT IT WOULD ALWAYS HOLD I LOST THE BET ON A TECHNICALITY BECAUSE EXAMPLES WERE PRODUCED OF SOLUTIONS WITH A SINGULARITY THAT WAS VISIBLE FROM A LONG WAY AWAY SO I HAD TO PAY UP WHICH ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE BET MEANT I HAD TO CLOTHE THEIR NAKEDNESS BUT I CAN CLAIM A MORAL VICTORY THE NAKED SINGULARITIES WERE UNSTABLE THE LEAST DISTURBANCE WOULD CAUSE THEM EITHER TO DISAPPEAR OR TO BE HIDDEN BEHIND AN EVENT HORIZON SO THEY WOULD NOT OCCUR IN REALISTIC SITUATIONS THE EVENT HORIZON THE BOUNDARY OF THE REGION OF SPACETIME FROM WHICH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESCAPE ACTS RATHER LIKE A ONEWAY MEMBRANE AROUND THE BLACK HOLE OBJECTS SUCH AS UNWARY ASTRONAUTS CAN FALL THROUGH THE EVENT HORIZON INTO THE BLACK HOLE BUT NOTHING CAN EVER GET OUT OF THE BLACK HOLE THROUGH THE EVENT HORIZON REMEMBER THAT THE EVENT HORIZON IS THE PATH IN SPACETIME OF LIGHT THAT IS TRYING TO ESCAPE FROM THE BLACK HOLE AND NOTHING CAN TRAVEL FASTER THAN LIGHT ONE COULD WELL SAY OF THE EVENT HORIZON WHAT THE POET DANTE SAID OF THE ENTRANCE TO HELL ALL HOPE ABANDON YE WHO ENTER HERE ANYTHING OR ANYONE WHO FALLS THROUGH THE EVENT HORIZON WILL SOON REACH THE REGION OF INFINITE DENSITY AND THE END OF TIME GENERAL RELATIVITY PREDICTS THAT HEAVY OBJECTS THAT ARE MOVING WILL CAUSE THE EMISSION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES RIPPLES IN THE CURVATURE OF SPACE THAT TRAVEL AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT THESE ARE SIMILAR TO LIGHT WAVES WHICH ARE RIPPLES OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD BUT THEY ARE MUCH HARDER TO DETECT THEY CAN BE OBSERVED BY THE VERY SLIGHT CHANGE IN SEPARATION THEY PRODUCE BETWEEN NEIGHBORING FREELY MOVING OBJECTS A NUMBER OF DETECTORS ARE BEING BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES EUROPE AND JAPAN THAT WILL MEASURE DISPLACEMENTS OF ONE PART IN A THOUSAND MILLION MILLION MILLION WITH TWENTYONE ZEROS AFTER IT OR LESS THAN THE NUCLEUS OF AN ATOM OVER A DISTANCE OF TEN MILES LIKE LIGHT GRAVITATIONAL WAVES CARRY ENERGY AWAY FROM THE OBJECTS THAT EMIT THEM ONE WOULD THEREFORE EXPECT A SYSTEM OF MASSIVE OBJECTS TO SETTLE DOWN EVENTUALLY TO A STATIONARY STATE BECAUSE THE ENERGY IN ANY MOVEMENT WOULD BE CARRIED AWAY BY THE EMISSION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES IT IS RATHER LIKE DROPPING A CORK INTO WATER AT FIRST IT BOBS UP AND DOWN A GREAT DEAL BUT AS THE RIPPLES CARRY AWAY ITS ENERGY IT EVENTUALLY SETTLES DOWN TO A STATIONARY STATE FOR EXAMPLE THE MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH IN ITS ORBIT ROUND THE SUN PRODUCES GRAVITATIONAL WAVES THE EFFECT OF THE ENERGY LOSS WILL BE TO CHANGE THE ORBIT OF THE EARTH SO THAT GRADUALLY IT GETS NEARER AND NEARER TO THE SUN EVENTUALLY COLLIDES WITH IT AND SETTLES DOWN TO A STATIONARY STATE THE RATE OF ENERGY LOSS IN THE CASE OF THE EARTH AND THE SUN IS VERY LOW ABOUT ENOUGH TO RUN A SMALL ELECTRIC HEATER THIS MEANS IT WILL TAKE ABOUT A THOUSAND MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION YEARS FOR THE EARTH TO RUN INTO THE SUN SO THERES NO IMMEDIATE CAUSE FOR WORRY THE CHANGE IN THE ORBIT OF THE EARTH IS TOO SLOW TO BE OBSERVED BUT THIS SAME EFFECT HAS BEEN OBSERVED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS OCCURRING IN THE SYSTEM CALLED PSR   PSR STANDS FOR PULSAR A SPECIAL TYPE OF NEUTRON STAR THAT EMITS REGULAR PULSES OF RADIO WAVES THIS SYSTEM CONTAINS TWO NEUTRON STARS ORBITING EACH OTHER AND THE ENERGY THEY ARE LOSING BY THE EMISSION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES IS CAUSING THEM TO SPIRAL IN TOWARD EACH OTHER THIS CONFIRMATION OF GENERAL RELATIVITY WON J H TAYLOR AND R A HULSE THE NOBEL PRIZE IN IT WILL TAKE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS FOR THEM TO COLLIDE JUST BEFORE THEY DO THEY WILL BE ORBITING SO FAST THAT THEY WILL EMIT ENOUGH GRAVITATIONAL WAVES FOR DETECTORS LIKE LIGO TO PICK UP DURING THE GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OF A STAR TO FORM A BLACK HOLE THE MOVEMENTS WOULD BE MUCH MORE RAPID SO THE RATE AT WHICH ENERGY IS CARRIED AWAY WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER IT WOULD THEREFORE NOT BE TOO LONG BEFORE IT SETTLED DOWN TO A STATIONARY STATE WHAT WOULD THIS FINAL STAGE LOOK LIKE ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT IT WOULD DEPEND ON ALL THE COMPLEX FEATURES OF THE STAR FROM WHICH IT HAD FORMED NOT ONLY ITS MASS AND RATE OF ROTATION BUT ALSO THE DIFFERENT DENSITIES OF VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STAR AND THE COMPLICATED MOVEMENTS OF THE GASES WITHIN THE STAR AND IF BLACK HOLES WERE AS VARIED AS THE OBJECTS THAT COLLAPSED TO FORM THEM IT MIGHT BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE ANY PREDICTIONS ABOUT BLACK HOLES IN GENERAL IN HOWEVER THE STUDY OF BLACK HOLES WAS REVOLUTIONIZED BY WERNER ISRAEL A CANADIAN SCIENTIST WHO WAS BORN IN BERLIN BROUGHT UP IN SOUTH AFRICA AND TOOK HIS DOCTORAL DEGREE IN IRELAND ISRAEL SHOWED THAT ACCORDING TO GENERAL RELATIVITY NONROTATING BLACK HOLES MUST BE VERY SIMPLE THEY WERE PERFECTLY SPHERICAL THEIR SIZE DEPENDED ONLY ON THEIR MASS AND ANY TWO SUCH BLACK HOLES WITH THE SAME MASS WERE IDENTICAL THEY COULD IN FACT BE DESCRIBED BY A PARTICULAR SOLUTION OF EINSTEINS EQUATIONS THAT HAD BEEN KNOWN SINCE FOUND BY KARL SCHWARZSCHILD SHORTLY AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF GENERAL RELATIVITY AT FIRST MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING ISRAEL HIMSELF ARGUED THAT SINCE BLACK HOLES HAD TO BE PERFECTLY SPHERICAL A BLACK HOLE COULD ONLY FORM FROM THE COLLAPSE OF A PERFECTLY SPHERICAL OBJECT ANY REAL STAR WHICH WOULD NEVER BE PERFECTLY SPHERICAL COULD THEREFORE ONLY COLLAPSE TO FORM A NAKED SINGULARITY THERE WAS HOWEVER A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF ISRAELS RESULT WHICH WAS ADVOCATED BY ROGER PENROSE AND JOHN WHEELER IN PARTICULAR THEY ARGUED THAT THE RAPID MOVEMENTS INVOLVED IN A STARS COLLAPSE WOULD MEAN THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES IT GAVE OFF WOULD MAKE IT EVER MORE SPHERICAL AND BY THE TIME IT HAD SETTLED DOWN TO A STATIONARY STATE IT WOULD BE PRECISELY SPHERICAL ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW ANY NONROTATING STAR HOWEVER COMPLICATED ITS SHAPE AND INTERNAL STRUCTURE WOULD END UP AFTER GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE AS A PERFECTLY SPHERICAL BLACK HOLE WHOSE SIZE WOULD DEPEND ONLY ON ITS MASS FURTHER CALCULATIONS SUPPORTED THIS VIEW AND IT SOON CAME TO BE ADOPTED GENERALLY ISRAELS RESULT DEALT WITH THE CASE OF BLACK HOLES FORMED FROM NONROTATING BODIES ONLY IN ROY KERR A NEW ZEALANDER FOUND A SET OF SOLUTIONS OF THE EQUATIONS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY THAT DESCRIBED ROTATING BLACK HOLES THESE KERR BLACK HOLES ROTATE AT A CONSTANT RATE THEIR SIZE AND SHAPE DEPENDING ONLY ON THEIR MASS AND RATE OF ROTATION IF THE ROTATION IS ZERO THE BLACK HOLE IS PERFECTLY ROUND AND THE SOLUTION IS IDENTICAL TO THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION IF THE ROTATION IS NONZERO THE BLACK HOLE BULGES OUTWARD NEAR ITS EQUATOR JUST AS THE EARTH OR THE SUN BULGE DUE TO THEIR ROTATION AND THE FASTER IT ROTATES THE MORE IT BULGES SO TO EXTEND ISRAELS RESULT TO INCLUDE ROTATING BODIES IT WAS CONJECTURED THAT ANY ROTATING BODY THAT COLLAPSED TO FORM A BLACK HOLE WOULD EVENTUALLY SETTLE DOWN TO A STATIONARY STATE DESCRIBED BY THE KERR SOLUTION IN A COLLEAGUE AND FELLOW RESEARCH STUDENT OF MINE AT CAMBRIDGE BRANDON CARTER TOOK THE FIRST STEP TOWARD PROVING THIS CONJECTURE HE SHOWED THAT PROVIDED A STATIONARY ROTATING BLACK HOLE HAD AN AXIS OF SYMMETRY LIKE A SPINNING TOP ITS SIZE AND SHAPE WOULD DEPEND ONLY ON ITS MASS AND RATE OF ROTATION THEN IN I PROVED THAT ANY STATIONARY ROTATING BLACK HOLE WOULD INDEED HAVE SUCH AN AXIS OF SYMMETRY FINALLY IN DAVID ROBINSON AT KINGS COLLEGE LONDON USED CARTERS AND MY RESULTS TO SHOW THAT THE CONJECTURE HAD BEEN CORRECT SUCH A BLACK HOLE HAD INDEED TO BE THE KERR SOLUTION SO AFTER GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE A BLACK HOLE MUST SETTLE DOWN INTO A STATE IN WHICH IT COULD BE ROTATING BUT NOT PULSATING MOREOVER ITS SIZE AND SHAPE WOULD DEPEND ONLY ON ITS MASS AND RATE OF ROTATION AND NOT ON THE NATURE OF THE BODY THAT HAD COLLAPSED TO FORM IT THIS RESULT BECAME KNOWN BY THE MAXIM A BLACK HOLE HAS NO HAIR THE NO HAIR THEOREM IS OF GREAT PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE BECAUSE IT SO GREATLY RESTRICTS THE POSSIBLE TYPES OF BLACK HOLES ONE CAN THEREFORE MAKE DETAILED MODELS OF OBJECTS THAT MIGHT CONTAIN BLACK HOLES AND COMPARE THE PREDICTIONS OF THE MODELS WITH OBSERVATIONS IT ALSO MEANS THAT A VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE BODY THAT HAS COLLAPSED MUST BE LOST WHEN A BLACK HOLE IS FORMED BECAUSE AFTERWARD ALL WE CAN POSSIBLY MEASURE ABOUT THE BODY IS ITS MASS AND RATE OF ROTATION THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS WILL BE SEEN IN THE NEXT CHAPTER BLACK HOLES ARE ONE OF ONLY A FAIRLY SMALL NUMBER OF CASES IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN WHICH A THEORY WAS DEVELOPED IN GREAT DETAIL AS A MATHEMATICAL MODEL BEFORE THERE WAS ANY EVIDENCE FROM OBSERVATIONS THAT IT WAS CORRECT INDEED THIS USED TO BE THE MAIN ARGUMENT OF OPPONENTS OF BLACK HOLES HOW COULD ONE BELIEVE IN OBJECTS FOR WHICH THE ONLY EVIDENCE WAS CALCULATIONS BASED ON THE DUBIOUS THEORY OF GENERAL RELATIVITY IN HOWEVER MAARTEN SCHMIDT AN ASTRONOMER AT THE PALOMAR OBSERVATORY IN CALIFORNIA MEASURED THE RED SHIFT OF A FAINT STARLIKE OBJECT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SOURCE OF RADIO WAVES CALLED C THAT IS SOURCE NUMBER IN THE THIRD CAMBRIDGE CATALOGUE OF RADIO SOURCES HE FOUND IT WAS TOO LARGE TO BE CAUSED BY A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD IF IT HAD BEEN A GRAVITATIONAL RED SHIFT THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE TO BE SO MASSIVE AND SO NEAR TO US THAT IT WOULD DISTURB THE ORBITS OF PLANETS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM THIS SUGGESTED THAT THE RED SHIFT WAS INSTEAD CAUSED BY THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE WHICH IN TURN MEANT THAT THE OBJECT WAS A VERY LONG DISTANCE AWAY AND TO BE VISIBLE AT SUCH A GREAT DISTANCE THE OBJECT MUST BE VERY BRIGHT MUST IN OTHER WORDS BE EMITTING A HUGE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THE ONLY MECHANISM THAT PEOPLE COULD THINK OF THAT WOULD PRODUCE SUCH LARGE QUANTITIES OF ENERGY SEEMED TO BE THE GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE NOT JUST OF A STAR BUT OF A WHOLE CENTRAL REGION OF A GALAXY A NUMBER OF OTHER SIMILAR QUASISTELLAR OBJECTS OR QUASARS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED ALL WITH LARGE RED SHIFTS BUT THEY ARE ALL TOO FAR AWAY AND THEREFORE TOO DIFFICULT TO OBSERVE TO PROVIDE CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF BLACK HOLES FURTHER ENCOURAGEMENT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF BLACK HOLES CAME IN WITH THE DISCOVERY BY A RESEARCH STUDENT AT CAMBRIDGE JOCELYN BELLBURNELL OF OBJECTS IN THE SKY THAT WERE EMITTING REGULAR PULSES OF RADIO WAVES AT FIRST BELL AND HER SUPERVISOR ANTONY HEWISH THOUGHT THEY MIGHT HAVE MADE CONTACT WITH AN ALIEN CIVILIZATION IN THE GALAXY INDEED AT THE SEMINAR AT WHICH THEY ANNOUNCED THEIR DISCOVERY I REMEMBER THAT THEY CALLED THE FIRST FOUR SOURCES TO BE FOUND LGM LGM STANDING FOR LITTLE GREEN MEN IN THE END HOWEVER THEY AND EVERYONE ELSE CAME TO THE LESS ROMANTIC CONCLUSION THAT THESE OBJECTS WHICH WERE GIVEN THE NAME PULSARS WERE IN FACT ROTATING NEUTRON STARS THAT WERE EMITTING PULSES OF RADIO WAVES BECAUSE OF A COMPLICATED INTERACTION BETWEEN THEIR MAGNETIC FIELDS AND SURROUNDING MATTER THIS WAS BAD NEWS FOR WRITERS OF SPACE WESTERNS BUT VERY HOPEFUL FOR THE SMALL NUMBER OF US WHO BELIEVED IN BLACK HOLES AT THAT TIME IT WAS THE FIRST POSITIVE EVIDENCE THAT NEUTRON STARS EXISTED A NEUTRON STAR HAS A RADIUS OF ABOUT TEN MILES ONLY A FEW TIMES THE CRITICAL RADIUS AT WHICH A STAR BECOMES A BLACK HOLE IF A STAR COULD COLLAPSE TO SUCH A SMALL SIZE IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT OTHER STARS COULD COLLAPSE TO EVEN SMALLER SIZE AND BECOME BLACK HOLES HOW COULD WE HOPE TO DETECT A BLACK HOLE AS BY ITS VERY DEFINITION IT DOES NOT EMIT ANY LIGHT IT MIGHT SEEM A BIT LIKE LOOKING FOR A BLACK CAT IN A COAL CELLAR FORTUNATELY THERE IS A WAY AS JOHN MICHELL POINTED OUT IN HIS PIONEERING PAPER IN  A BLACK HOLE STILL EXERTS A GRAVITATIONAL FIERCE ON NEARBY OBJECTS ASTRONOMERS HAVE OBSERVED MANY SYSTEMS IN WHICH TWO STARS ORBIT AROUND EACH OTHER ATTRACTED TOWARD EACH OTHER BY GRAVITY THEY ALSO OBSERVE SYSTEMS IN WHICH THERE IS ONLY ONE VISIBLE STAR THAT IS ORBITING AROUND SOME UNSEEN COMPANION ONE CANNOT OF COURSE IMMEDIATELY CONCLUDE THAT THE COMPANION IS A BLACK HOLE IT MIGHT MERELY BE A STAR THAT IS TOO FAINT TO BE SEEN HOWEVER SOME OF THESE SYSTEMS LIKE THE ONE CALLED CYGNUS X ARE ALSO STRONG SOURCES OF XRAYS THE BEST EXPLANATION FOR THIS PHENOMENON IS THAT MATTER HAS BEEN BLOWN OFF THE SURFACE OF THE VISIBLE STAR AS IT FALLS TOWARD THE UNSEEN COMPANION IT DEVELOPS A SPIRAL MOTION RATHER LIKE WATER RUNNING OUT OF A BATH AND IT GETS VERY HOT EMITTING XRAYS FOR THIS MECHANISM TO WORK THE UNSEEN OBJECT HAS TO BE VERY SMALL LIKE A WHITE DWARF NEUTRON STAR OR BLACK HOLE FROM THE OBSERVED ORBIT OF THE VISIBLE STAR ONE CAN DETERMINE THE LOWEST POSSIBLE MASS OF THE UNSEEN OBJECT IN THE CASE OF CYGNUS XL THIS IS ABOUT SIX TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN WHICH ACCORDING TO CHANDRASEKHARR RESULT IS TOO GREAT FOR THE UNSEEN OBJECT TO BE A WHITE DWARF IT IS ALSO TOO LARGE A MASS TO BE A NEUTRON STAR IT SEEMS THEREFORE THAT IT MUST BE A BLACK HOLE THERE ARE OTHER MODELS TO EXPLAIN CYGNUS X THAT DO NOT INCLUDE A BLACK HOLE BUT THEY ARE ALL RATHER FARFETCHED A BLACK HOLE SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY REALLY NATURAL EXPLANATION OF THE OBSERVATIONS DESPITE THIS I HAD A BET WITH KIP THORNE OF THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT IN FACT CYGNUS X DOES NOT CONTAIN A BLACK HOLE THIS WAS A FORM F INSURANCE POLICY FOR ME I HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON BLACK HOLES AND IT WOULD ALL BE WASTED IF IT TURNED OUT THAT BLACK HOLES DO NOT EXIST BUT IN THAT CASE I WOULD HAVE THE CONSOLATION OF WINNING MY BET WHICH WOULD BRING ME FOUR YEARS OF THE MAGAZINE PRIVATE EYE IN FACT ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION WITH CYGNUS X HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH SINCE WE MADE THE BET IN THERE IS NOW SO MUCH OTHER OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF BLACK HOLES THAT I HAVE CONCEDED THE BET I PAID THE SPECIFIED PENALTY WHICH WAS A ONEYEAR SUBSCRIPTION TO PENTHOUSE TO THE OUTRAGE OF KIPS LIBERATED WIFE WE ALSO NOW HAVE EVIDENCE FOR SEVERAL OTHER BLACK HOLES IN SYSTEMS LIKE CYGNUS X IN OUR GALAXY AND IN TWO NEIGHBORING GALAXIES CALLED THE MAGELLANIC CLOUDS THE NUMBER OF BLACK HOLES HOWEVER IS ALMOST CERTAINLY VERY MUCH HIGHER IN THE LONG HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE MANY STARS MUST HAVE BURNED ALL THEIR NUCLEAR FUEL AND HAVE HAD TO COLLAPSE THE NUMBER OF BLACK HOLES MAY WELL BE GREATER EVEN THAN THE NUMBER OF VISIBLE STARS WHICH TOTALS ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND MILLION IN OUR GALAXY ALONE THE EXTRA GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION OF SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF BLACK HOLES COULD EXPLAIN WHY OUR GALAXY ROTATES AT THE RATE IT DOES THE MASS OF THE VISIBLE STARS IS INSUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS WE ALSO HAVE SOME EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS A MUCH LARGER BLACK HOLE WITH A MASS OF ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES THAT OF THE SUN AT THE CENTER OF OUR GALAXY STARS IN THE GALAXY THAT COME TOO NEAR THIS BLACK HOLE WILL BE TORN APART BY THE DIFFERENCE IN THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCES ON THEIR NEAR AND FAR SIDES THEIR REMAINS AND GAS THAT IS THROWN OFF OTHER STARS WILL FALL TOWARD THE BLACK HOLE AS IN THE CASE OF CYGNUS XL THE GAS WILL SPIRAL INWARD AND WILL HEAT UP THOUGH NOT AS MUCH AS IN THAT CASE IT WILL NOT GET HOT ENOUGH TO EMIT X RAYS BUT IT COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE VERY COMPACT SOURCE OF RADIO WAVES AND INFRARED RAYS THAT IS OBSERVED AT THE GALACTIC CENTER IT IS THOUGHT THAT SIMILAR BUT EVEN LARGER BLACK HOLES WITH MASSES OF ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN OCCUR AT THE CENTERS OF QUASARS FOR EXAMPLE OBSERVATIONS WITH THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE OF THE GALAXY KNOWN AS M  REVEAL THAT IT CONTAINS A DISK OF GAS LIGHTYEARS ACROSS ROTATING ABOUT A CENTRAL OBJECT TWO THOUSAND MILLION TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN THIS CAN ONLY BE A BLACK HOLE MATTER FALLING INTO SUCH A SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE WOULD PROVIDE THE ONLY SOURCE OF POWER GREAT ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN THE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF ENERGY THAT THESE OBJECTS ARE EMITTING AS THE MATTER SPIRALS INTO THE BLACK HOLE IT WOULD MAKE THE BLACK HOLE ROTATE IN THE SAME DIRECTION CAUSING IT TO DEVELOP A MAGNETIC FIELD RATHER LIKE THAT OF THE EARTH VERY HIGHENERGY PARTICLES WOULD BE GENERATED NEAR THE BLACK HOLE BY THE INFALLING MATTER THE MAGNETIC FIELD WOULD BE SO STRONG THAT IT COULD FOCUS THESE PARTICLES INTO JETS EJECTED OUTWARD ALONG THE AXIS OF ROTATION OF THE BLACK HOLE THAT IS IN THE DIRECTIONS OF ITS NORTH AND SOUTH POLES SUCH JETS ARE INDEED OBSERVED IN A NUMBER OF GALAXIES AND QUASARS ONE CAN ALSO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MIGHT BE BLACK HOLES WITH MASSES MUCH LESS THAN THAT OF THE SUN SUCH BLACK HOLES COULD NOT BE FORMED BY GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEIR MASSES ARE BELOW THE CHANDRASEKHAR MASS LIMIT STARS OF THIS LOW MASS CAN SUPPORT THEMSELVES AGAINST THE FORCE OF GRAVITY EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR NUCLEAR FUEL LOWMASS BLACK HOLES COULD FORM ONLY IF MATTER WAS COMPRESSED TO ENORMOUS DENSITIES BY VERY LARGE EXTERNAL PRESSURES SUCH CONDITIONS COULD OCCUR IN A VERY BIG HYDROGEN BOMB THE PHYSICIST JOHN WHEELER ONCE CALCULATED THAT IF ONE TOOK ALL THE HEAVY WATER IN ALL THE OCEANS OF THE WORLD ONE COULD BUILD A HYDROGEN BOMB THAT WOULD COMPRESS MATTER AT THE CENTER SO MUCH THAT A BLACK HOLE WOULD BE CREATED OF COURSE THERE WOULD BE NO ONE LEFT TO OBSERVE IT A MORE PRACTICAL POSSIBILITY IS THAT SUCH LOWMASS BLACK HOLES MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORMED IN THE HIGH TEMPERATURES AND PRESSURES OF THE VERY EARLY UNIVERSE BLACK HOLES WOULD HAVE BEEN FORMED ONLY IF THE EARLY UNIVERSE HAD NOT BEEN PERFECTLY SMOOTH AND UNIFORM BECAUSE ONLY A SMALL REGION THAT WAS DENSER THAN AVERAGE COULD BE COMPRESSED IN THIS WAY TO FORM A BLACK HOLE BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME IRREGULARITIES BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE WOULD STILL BE PERFECTLY UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED AT THE PRESENT EPOCH INSTEAD OF BEING CLUMPED TOGETHER IN STARS AND GALAXIES WHETHER THE IRREGULARITIES REQUIRED TO ACCOUNT FOR STARS AND GALAXIES WOULD HAVE LED TO THE FORMATION OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES CLEARLY DEPENDS ON THE DETAILS OF THE CONDITIONS IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE SO IF WE COULD DETERMINE HOW MANY PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES THERE ARE NOW WE WOULD LEARN A LOT ABOUT THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF THE UNIVERSE PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES WITH MASSES MORE THAN A THOUSAND MILLION TONS THE MASS OF A LARGE MOUNTAIN COULD BE DETECTED ONLY BY THEIR GRAVITATIONAL INFLUENCE ON OTHER VISIBLE MATTER OR ON THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE HOWEVER AS WE SHALL LEARN IN THE NEXT CHAPTER BLACK HOLES ARE NOT REALLY BLACK AFTER ALL THEY GLOW LIKE A HOT BODY AND THE SMALLER THEY ARE THE MORE THEY GLOW SO PARADOXICALLY SMALLER BLACK HOLES MIGHT ACTUALLY TURN OUT TO BE EASIER TO DETECT THAN LARGE ONES BEFORE MY RESEARCH ON GENERAL RELATIVITY HAD CONCENTRATED MAINLY ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE HAD BEEN A BIG BANG SINGULARITY HOWEVER ONE EVENING IN NOVEMBER THAT YEAR SHORTLY AFTER THE BIRTH OF MY DAUGHTER LUCY I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT BLACK HOLES AS I WAS GETTING INTO BED MY DISABILITY MAKES THIS RATHER A SLOW PROCESS SO I HAD PLENTY OF TIME AT THAT DATE THERE WAS NO PRECISE DEFINITION OF WHICH POINTS IN SPACETIME LAY INSIDE A BLACK HOLE AND WHICH LAY OUTSIDE I HAD ALREADY DISCUSSED WITH ROGER PENROSE THE IDEA OF DEFINING A BLACK HOLE AS THE SET OF EVENTS FROM WHICH IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESCAPE TO A LARGE DISTANCE WHICH IS NOW THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED DEFINITION IT MEANS THAT THE BOUNDARY OF THE BLACK HOLE THE EVENT HORIZON IS FORMED BY THE LIGHT RAYS THAT JUST FAIL TO ESCAPE FROM THE BLACK HOLE HOVERING FOREVER JUST ON THE EDGE FIGURE IT IS A BIT LIKE RUNNING AWAY FROM THE POLICE AND JUST MANAGING TO KEEP ONE STEP AHEAD BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO GET CLEAR AWAY SUDDENLY I REALIZED THAT THE PATHS OF THESE LIGHT RAYS COULD NEVER APPROACH ONE ANOTHER IF THEY DID THEY MUST EVENTUALLY RUN INTO ONE ANOTHER IT WOULD BE LIKE MEETING SOMEONE ELSE RUNNING AWAY FROM THE POLICE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION YOU WOULD BOTH BE CAUGHT OR IN THIS CASE FALL INTO A BLACK HOLE BUT IF THESE LIGHT RAYS WERE SWALLOWED UP BY THE BLACK HOLE THEN THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ON THE BOUNDARY OF THE BLACK HOLE SO THE PATHS OF LIGHT RAYS IN THE EVENT HORIZON HAD ALWAYS TO BE MOVING PARALLEL TO OR AWAY FROM EACH OTHER ANOTHER WAY OF SEEING THIS IS THAT THE EVENT HORIZON THE BOUNDARY OF THE BLACK HOLE IS LIKE THE EDGE OF A SHADOW THE SHADOW OF IMPENDING DOOM IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHADOW CAST BY A SOURCE AT A GREAT DISTANCE SUCH AS THE SUN YOU WILL SEE THAT THE RAYS OF LIGHT IN THE EDGE ARE NOT APPROACHING EACH OTHER IF THE RAYS OF LIGHT THAT FORM THE EVENT HORIZON THE BOUNDARY OF THE BLACK HOLE CAN NEVER APPROACH EACH OTHER THE AREA OF THE EVENT HORIZON MIGHT STAY THE SAME OR INCREASE WITH TIME BUT IT COULD NEVER DECREASE BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THE RAYS OF LIGHT IN THE BOUNDARY WOULD HAVE TO BE APPROACHING EACH OTHER IN FACT THE AREA WOULD INCREASE WHENEVER MATTER OR RADIATION FELL INTO THE BLACK HOLE OR IF TWO BLACK HOLES COLLIDED AND MERGED TOGETHER TO FORM A SINGLE BLACK HOLE THE AREA OF THE EVENT HORIZON OF THE FINAL BLACK HOLE WOULD BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE SUM OF THE AREAS OF THE EVENT HORIZONS OF THE ORIGINAL BLACK HOLES FIGURE THIS NONDECREASING PROPERTY OF THE EVENT HORIZONS AREA PLACED AN IMPORTANT RESTRICTION ON THE POSSIBLE BEHAVIOR OF BLACK HOLES I WAS SO EXCITED WITH MY DISCOVERY THAT I DID NOT GET MUCH SLEEP THAT NIGHT THE NEXT DAY I RANG UP ROGER PENROSE HE AGREED WITH ME I THINK IN FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN AWARE OF THIS PROPERTY OF THE AREA HOWEVER HE HAD BEEN USING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF A BLACK HOLE HE HAD NOT REALIZED THAT THE BOUNDARIES OF THE BLACK HOLE ACCORDING TO THE TWO DEFINITIONS WOULD BE THE SAME AND HENCE SO WOULD THEIR AREAS PROVIDED THE BLACK HOLE HAD SETTLED DOWN TO A STATE IN WHICH IT WAS NOT CHANGING WITH TIME THE NONDECREASING BEHAVIOR OF A BLACK HOLES AREA WAS VERY REMINISCENT OF THE BEHAVIOR OF A PHYSICAL QUANTITY CALLED ENTROPY WHICH MEASURES THE DEGREE OF DISORDER OF A SYSTEM IT IS A MATTER OF COMMON EXPERIENCE THAT DISORDER WILL TEND TO INCREASE IF THINGS ARE LEFT TO THEMSELVES ONE HAS ONLY TO STOP MAKING REPAIRS AROUND THE HOUSE TO SEE THAT ONE CAN CREATE ORDER OUT OF DISORDER FOR EXAMPLE ONE CAN PAINT THE HOUSE BUT THAT REQUIRES EXPENDITURE OF EFFORT OR ENERGY AND SO DECREASES THE AMOUNT OF ORDERED ENERGY AVAILABLE A PRECISE STATEMENT OF THIS IDEA IS KNOWN AS THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS IT STATES THAT THE ENTROPY OF AN ISOLATED SYSTEM ALWAYS INCREASES AND THAT WHEN TWO SYSTEMS ARE JOINED TOGETHER THE ENTROPY OF THE COMBINED SYSTEM IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE ENTROPIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL SYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE CONSIDER A SYSTEM OF GAS MOLECULES IN A BOX THE MOLECULES CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS LITTLE BILLIARD BALLS CONTINUALLY COLLIDING WITH EACH OTHER AND BOUNCING OFF THE WALLS OF THE BOX THE HIGHER THE TEMPERATURE OF THE GAS THE FASTER THE MOLECULES MOVE AND SO THE MORE FREQUENTLY AND HARDER THEY COLLIDE WITH THE WALLS OF THE BOX AND THE GREATER THE OUTWARD PRESSURE THEY EXERT ON THE WALLS SUPPOSE THAT INITIALLY THE MOLECULES ARE ALL CONFINED TO THE LEFTHAND SIDE OF THE BOX BY A PARTITION IF THE PARTITION IS THEN REMOVED THE MOLECULES WILL TEND TO SPREAD OUT AND OCCUPY BOTH HALVES OF THE BOX AT SOME LATER TIME THEY COULD BY CHANCE ALL BE IN THE RIGHT HALF OR BACK IN THE LEFT HALF BUT IT IS OVERWHELMINGLY MORE PROBABLE THAT THERE WILL BE ROUGHLY EQUAL NUMBERS IN THE TWO HALVES SUCH A STATE IS LESS ORDERED OR MORE DISORDERED THAN THE ORIGINAL STATE IN WHICH ALL THE MOLECULES WERE IN ONE HALF ONE THEREFORE SAYS THAT THE ENTROPY OF THE GAS HAS GONE UP SIMILARLY SUPPOSE ONE STARTS WITH TWO BOXES ONE CONTAINING OXYGEN MOLECULES AND THE OTHER CONTAINING NITROGEN MOLECULES IF ONE JOINS THE BOXES TOGETHER AND REMOVES THE INTERVENING WALL THE OXYGEN AND THE NITROGEN MOLECULES WILL START TO MIX AT A LATER TIME THE MOST PROBABLE STATE WOULD BE A FAIRLY UNIFORM MIXTURE OF OXYGEN AND NITROGEN MOLECULES THROUGHOUT THE TWO BOXES THIS STATE WOULD BE LESS ORDERED AND HENCE HAVE MORE ENTROPY THAN THE INITIAL STATE OF TWO SEPARATE BOXES THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS HAS A RATHER DIFFERENT STATUS THAN THAT OF OTHER LAWS OF SCIENCE SUCH AS NEWTONS LAW OF GRAVITY FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HOLD ALWAYS JUST IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES THE PROBABILITY OF ALL THE GAS MOLECULES IN OUR FIRST BOX FOUND IN ONE HALF OF THE BOX AT A LATER TIME IS MANY MILLIONS OF MILLIONS TO ONE BUT IT CAN HAPPEN HOWEVER IF ONE HAS A BLACK HOLE AROUND THERE SEEMS TO BE A RATHER EASIER WAY OF VIOLATING THE SECOND LAW JUST THROW SOME MATTER WITH A LOT OF ENTROPY SUCH AS A BOX OF GAS DOWN THE BLACK HOLE THE TOTAL ENTROPY OF MATTER OUTSIDE THE BLACK HOLE WOULD GO DOWN ONE COULD OF COURSE STILL SAY THAT THE TOTAL ENTROPY INCLUDING THE ENTROPY INSIDE THE BLACK HOLE HAS NOT GONE DOWN BUT SINCE THERE IS NO WAY TO LOOK INSIDE THE BLACK HOLE WE CANNOT SEE HOW MUCH ENTROPY THE MATTER INSIDE IT HAS IT WOULD BE NICE THEN IF THERE WAS SOME FEATURE OF THE BLACK HOLE BY WHICH OBSERVERS OUTSIDE THE BLACK HOLE COULD TELL ITS ENTROPY AND WHICH WOULD INCREASE WHENEVER MATTER CARRYING ENTROPY FELL INTO THE BLACK HOLE FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY DESCRIBED ABOVE THAT THE AREA OF THE EVENT HORIZON INCREASED WHENEVER MATTER FELL INTO A BLACK HOLE A RESEARCH STUDENT AT PRINCETON NAMED JACOB BEKENSTEIN SUGGESTED THAT THE AREA OF THE EVENT HORIZON WAS A MEASURE OF THE ENTROPY OF THE BLACK HOLE AS MATTER CARRYING ENTROPY FELL INTO A BLACK HOLE THE AREA OF ITS EVENT HORIZON WOULD GO UP SO THAT THE SUM OF THE ENTROPY OF MATTER OUTSIDE BLACK HOLES AND THE AREA OF THE HORIZONS WOULD NEVER GO DOWN THIS SUGGESTION SEEMED TO PREVENT THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS FROM BEING VIOLATED IN MOST SITUATIONS HOWEVER THERE WAS ONE FATAL FLAW IF A BLACK HOLE HAS ENTROPY THEN IT OUGHT TO ALSO HAVE A TEMPERATURE BUT A BODY WITH A PARTICULAR TEMPERATURE MUST EMIT RADIATION AT A CERTAIN RATE IT IS A MATTER OF COMMON EXPERIENCE THAT IF ONE HEATS UP A POKER IN A FIRE IT GLOWS RED HOT AND EMITS RADIATION BUT BODIES AT LOWER TEMPERATURES EMIT RADIATION TOO ONE JUST DOES NOT NORMALLY NOTICE IT BECAUSE THE AMOUNT IS FAIRLY SMALL THIS RADIATION IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO PREVENT VIOLATION OF THE SECOND LAW SO BLACK HOLES OUGHT TO EMIT RADIATION BUT BY THEIR VERY DEFINITION BLACK HOLES ARE OBJECTS THAT ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO EMIT ANYTHING IT THEREFORE SEEMED THAT THE AREA OF THE EVENT HORIZON OF A BLACK HOLE COULD NOT BE REGARDED AS ITS ENTROPY IN I WROTE A PAPER WITH BRANDON CARTER AND AN AMERICAN COLLEAGUE JIM BARDEEN IN WHICH WE POINTED OUT THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WERE MANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN ENTROPY AND THE AREA OF THE EVENT HORIZON THERE WAS THIS APPARENTLY FATAL DIFFICULTY I MUST ADMIT THAT IN WRITING THIS PAPER I WAS MOTIVATED PARTLY BY IRRITATION WITH BEKENSTEIN WHO I FELT HAD MISUSED MY DISCOVERY OF THE INCREASE OF THE AREA OF THE EVENT HORIZON HOWEVER IT TURNED OUT IN THE END THAT HE WAS BASICALLY CORRECT THOUGH IN A MANNER HE HAD CERTAINLY NOT EXPECTED IN SEPTEMBER WHILE I WAS VISITING MOSCOW I DISCUSSED BLACK HOLES WITH TWO LEADING SOVIET EXPERTS YAKOV ZELDOVICH AND ALEXANDER STAROBINSKY THEY CONVINCED ME THAT ACCORDING TO THE QUANTUM MECHANICAL UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE ROTATING BLACK HOLES SHOULD CREATE AND EMIT PARTICLES I BELIEVED THEIR ARGUMENTS ON PHYSICAL GROUNDS BUT I DID NOT LIKE THE MATHEMATICAL WAY IN WHICH THEY CALCULATED THE EMISSION I THEREFORE SET ABOUT DEVISING A BETTER MATHEMATICAL TREATMENT WHICH I DESCRIBED AT AN INFORMAL SEMINAR IN OXFORD AT THE END OF NOVEMBER AT THAT TIME I HAD NOT DONE THE CALCULATIONS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH WOULD ACTUALLY BE EMITTED I WAS EXPECTING TO DISCOVER JUST THE RADIATION THAT ZELDOVICH AND STAROBINSKY HAD PREDICTED FROM ROTATING BLACK HOLES HOWEVER WHEN I DID THE CALCULATION I FOUND TO MY SURPRISE AND ANNOYANCE THAT EVEN NONROTATING BLACK HOLES SHOULD APPARENTLY CREATE AND EMIT PARTICLES AT A STEADY RATE AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT THIS EMISSION INDICATED THAT ONE OF THE APPROXIMATIONS I HAD USED WAS NOT VALID I WAS AFRAID THAT IF BEKENSTEIN FOUND OUT ABOUT IT HE WOULD USE IT AS A FURTHER ARGUMENT TO SUPPORT HIS IDEAS ABOUT THE ENTROPY OF BLACK HOLES WHICH I STILL DID NOT LIKE HOWEVER THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT THE MORE IT SEEMED THAT THE APPROXIMATIONS REALLY OUGHT TO HOLD BUT WHAT FINALLY CONVINCED ME THAT THE EMISSION WAS REAL WAS THAT THE SPECTRUM OF THE EMITTED PARTICLES WAS EXACTLY THAT WHICH WOULD BE EMITTED BY A HOT BODY AND THAT THE BLACK HOLE WAS EMITTING PARTICLES AT EXACTLY THE CORRECT RATE TO PREVENT VIOLATIONS OF THE SECOND LAW SINCE THEN THE CALCULATIONS HAVE BEEN REPEATED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FORMS BY OTHER PEOPLE THEY ALL CONFIRM THAT A BLACK HOLE OUGHT TO EMIT PARTICLES AND RADIATION AS IF IT WERE A HOT BODY WITH A TEMPERATURE THAT DEPENDS ONLY ON THE BLACK HOLES MASS THE HIGHER THE MASS THE LOWER THE TEMPERATURE HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A BLACK HOLE APPEARS TO EMIT PARTICLES WHEN WE KNOW THAT NOTHING CAN ESCAPE FROM WITHIN ITS EVENT HORIZON THE ANSWER QUANTUM THEORY TELLS US IS THAT THE PARTICLES DO NOT COME FROM WITHIN THE BLACK HOLE BUT FROM THE EMPTY SPACE JUST OUTSIDE THE BLACK HOLES EVENT HORIZON WE CAN UNDERSTAND THIS IN THE FOLLOWING WAY WHAT WE THINK OF AS EMPTY SPACE CANNOT BE COMPLETELY EMPTY BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT ALL THE FIELDS SUCH AS THE GRAVITATIONAL AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS WOULD HAVE TO BE EXACTLY ZERO HOWEVER THE VALUE OF A FIELD AND ITS RATE OF CHANGE WITH TIME ARE LIKE THE POSITION AND VELOCITY OF A PARTICLE THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IMPLIES THAT THE MORE ACCURATELY ONE KNOWS ONE OF THESE QUANTITIES THE LESS ACCURATELY ONE CAN KNOW THE OTHER SO IN EMPTY SPACE THE FIELD CANNOT BE FIXED AT EXACTLY ZERO BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD HAVE BOTH A PRECISE VALUE ZERO AND A PRECISE RATE OF CHANGE ALSO ZERO THERE MUST BE A CERTAIN MINIMUM AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY OR QUANTUM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THE FIELD ONE CAN THINK OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS AS PAIRS OF PARTICLES OF LIGHT OR GRAVITY THAT APPEAR TOGETHER AT SOME TIME MOVE APART AND THEN COME TOGETHER AGAIN AND ANNIHILATE EACH OTHER THESE PARTICLES ARE VIRTUAL PARTICLES LIKE THE PARTICLES THAT CARRY THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE OF THE SUN UNLIKE REAL PARTICLES THEY CANNOT BE OBSERVED DIRECTLY WITH A PARTICLE DETECTOR HOWEVER THEIR INDIRECT EFFECTS SUCH AS SMALL CHANGES IN THE ENERGY OF ELECTRON ORBITS IN ATOMS CAN BE MEASURED AND AGREE WITH THE THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS TO A REMARKABLE DEGREE OF ACCURACY THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE ALSO PREDICTS THAT THERE WILL BE SIMILAR VIRTUAL PAIRS OF MATTER PARTICLES SUCH AS ELECTRONS OR QUARKS IN THIS CASE HOWEVER ONE MEMBER OF THE PAIR WILL BE A PARTICLE AND THE OTHER AN ANTIPARTICLE THE ANTIPARTICLES OF LIGHT AND GRAVITY ARE THE SAME AS THE PARTICLES BECAUSE ENERGY CANNOT BE CREATED OUT OF NOTHING ONE OF THE PARTNERS IN A PARTICLEANTIPARTICLE PAIR WILL HAVE POSITIVE ENERGY AND THE OTHER PARTNER NEGATIVE ENERGY THE ONE WITH NEGATIVE ENERGY IS CONDEMNED TO BE A SHORTLIVED VIRTUAL PARTICLE BECAUSE REAL PARTICLES ALWAYS HAVE POSITIVE ENERGY IN NORMAL SITUATIONS IT MUST THEREFORE SEEK OUT ITS PARTNER AND ANNIHILATE WITH IT HOWEVER A REAL PARTICLE CLOSE TO A MASSIVE BODY HAS LESS ENERGY THAN IF IT WERE FAR AWAY BECAUSE IT WOULD TAKE ENERGY TO LIFT IT FAR AWAY AGAINST THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION OF THE BODY NORMALLY THE ENERGY OF THE PARTICLE IS STILL POSITIVE BUT THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD INSIDE A BLACK HOLE IS SO STRONG THAT EVEN A REAL PARTICLE CAN HAVE NEGATIVE ENERGY THERE IT IS THEREFORE POSSIBLE IF A BLACK HOLE IS PRESENT FOR THE VIRTUAL PARTICLE WITH NEGATIVE ENERGY TO FALL INTO THE BLACK HOLE AND BECOME A REAL PARTICLE OR ANTIPARTICLE IN THIS CASE IT NO LONGER HAS TO ANNIHILATE WITH ITS PARTNER ITS FORSAKEN PARTNER MAY FALL INTO THE BLACK HOLE AS WELL OR HAVING POSITIVE ENERGY IT MIGHT ALSO ESCAPE FROM THE VICINITY OF THE BLACK HOLE AS A REAL PARTICLE OR ANTIPARTICLE TO AN OBSERVER AT A DISTANCE IT WILL APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN EMITTED FROM THE BLACK HOLE THE SMALLER THE BLACK HOLE THE SHORTER THE DISTANCE THE PARTICLE WITH NEGATIVE ENERGY WILL HAVE TO GO BEFORE IT BECOMES A REAL PARTICLE AND THUS THE GREATER THE RATE OF EMISSION AND THE APPARENT TEMPERATURE OF THE BLACK HOLE THE POSITIVE ENERGY OF THE OUTGOING RADIATION WOULD BE BALANCED BY A FLOW OF NEGATIVE ENERGY PARTICLES INTO THE BLACK HOLE BY EINSTEINS EQUATION E MC WHERE E IS ENERGY M IS MASS AND C IS THE SPEED OF LIGHT ENERGY IS PROPORTIONAL TO MASS A FLOW OF NEGATIVE ENERGY INTO THE BLACK HOLE THEREFORE REDUCES ITS MASS AS THE BLACK HOLE LOSES MASS THE AREA OF ITS EVENT HORIZON GETS SMALLER BUT THIS DECREASE IN THE ENTROPY OF THE BLACK HOLE IS MORE THAN COMPENSATED FOR BY THE ENTROPY OF THE EMITTED RADIATION SO THE SECOND LAW IS NEVER VIOLATED MOREOVER THE LOWER THE MASS OF THE BLACK HOLE THE HIGHER ITS TEMPERATURE SO AS THE BLACK HOLE LOSES MASS ITS TEMPERATURE AND RATE OF EMISSION INCREASE SO IT LOSES MASS MORE QUICKLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MASS OF THE BLACK HOLE EVENTUALLY BECOMES EXTREMELY SMALL IS NOT QUITE CLEAR BUT THE MOST REASONABLE GUESS IS THAT IT WOULD DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY IN A TREMENDOUS FINAL BURST OF EMISSION EQUIVALENT TO THE EXPLOSION OF MILLIONS OF HBOMBS A BLACK HOLE WITH A MASS A FEW TIMES THAT OF THE SUN WOULD HAVE A TEMPERATURE OF ONLY ONE TEN MILLIONTH OF A DEGREE ABOVE ABSOLUTE ZERO THIS IS MUCH LESS THAN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE MICROWAVE RADIATION THAT FILLS THE UNIVERSE ABOUT  ABOVE ABSOLUTE ZERO SO SUCH BLACK HOLES WOULD EMIT EVEN LESS THAN THEY ABSORB IF THE UNIVERSE IS DESTINED TO GO ON EXPANDING FOREVER THE TEMPERATURE OF THE MICROWAVE RADIATION WILL EVENTUALLY DECREASE TO LESS THAN THAT OF SUCH A BLACK HOLE WHICH WILL THEN BEGIN TO LOSE MASS BUT EVEN THEN ITS TEMPERATURE WOULD BE SO LOW THAT IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT A MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION YEARS WITH SIXTYSIX ZEROS AFTER IT TO EVAPORATE COMPLETELY THIS IS MUCH LONGER THAN THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE WHICH IS ONLY ABOUT TEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND MILLION YEARS OR WITH TEN ZEROS AFTER IT ON THE OTHER HAND AS MENTIONED IN CHAPTER THERE MIGHT BE PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES WITH A VERY MUCH SMALLER MASS THAT WERE MADE BY THE COLLAPSE OF IRREGULARITIES IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF THE UNIVERSE SUCH BLACK HOLES WOULD HAVE A MUCH HIGHER TEMPERATURE AND WOULD BE EMITTING RADIATION AT A MUCH GREATER RATE A PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLE WITH AN INITIAL MASS OF A THOUSAND MILLION TONS WOULD HAVE A LIFETIME ROUGHLY EQUAL TO THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES WITH INITIAL MASSES LESS THAN THIS FIGURE WOULD ALREADY HAVE COMPLETELY EVAPORATED BUT THOSE WITH SLIGHTLY GREATER MASSES WOULD STILL BE EMITTING RADIATION IN THE FORM OF X RAYS AND GAMMA RAYS THESE X RAYS AND GAMMA RAYS ARE LIKE WAVES OF LIGHT BUT WITH A MUCH SHORTER WAVELENGTH SUCH HOLES HARDLY DESERVE THE EPITHET BLACK THEY REALLY ARE WHITE HOT AND ARE EMITTING ENERGY AT A RATE OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS ONE SUCH BLACK HOLE COULD RUN TEN LARGE POWER STATIONS IF ONLY WE COULD HARNESS ITS POWER THIS WOULD BE RATHER DIFFICULT HOWEVER THE BLACK HOLE WOULD HAVE THE MASS OF A MOUNTAIN COMPRESSED INTO LESS THAN A MILLION MILLIONTH OF AN INCH THE SIZE OF THE NUCLEUS OF AN ATOM IF YOU HAD ONE OF THESE BLACK HOLES ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH THERE WOULD BE NO WAY TO STOP IT FROM FALLING THROUGH THE FLOOR TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH IT WOULD OSCILLATE THROUGH THE EARTH AND BACK UNTIL EVENTUALLY IT SETTLED DOWN AT THE CENTER SO THE ONLY PLACE TO PUT SUCH A BLACK HOLE IN WHICH ONE MIGHT USE THE ENERGY THAT IT EMITTED WOULD BE IN ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH AND THE ONLY WAY THAT ONE COULD GET IT TO ORBIT THE EARTH WOULD BE TO ATTRACT IT THERE BY TOWING A LARGE MASS IN FRONT OF IT RATHER LIKE A CARROT IN FRONT OF A DONKEY THIS DOES NOT SOUND LIKE A VERY PRACTICAL PROPOSITION AT LEAST NOT IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE BUT EVEN IF WE CANNOT HARNESS THE EMISSION FROM THESE PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES WHAT ARE OUR CHANCES OF OBSERVING THEM WE COULD LOOK FOR THE GAMMA RAYS THAT THE PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES EMIT DURING MOST OF THEIR LIFETIME ALTHOUGH THE RADIATION FROM MOST WOULD BE VERY WEAK BECAUSE THEY ARE FAR AWAY THE TOTAL FROM ALL OF THEM MIGHT BE DETECTABLE WE DO OBSERVE SUCH A BACKGROUND OF GAMMA RAYS FIGURE SHOWS HOW THE OBSERVED INTENSITY DIFFERS AT DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES THE NUMBER OF WAVES PER SECOND HOWEVER THIS BACKGROUND COULD HAVE BEEN AND PROBABLY WAS GENERATED BY PROCESSES OTHER THAN PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES THE DOTTED LINE IN FIGURE SHOWS HOW THE INTENSITY SHOULD VARY WITH FREQUENCY FOR GAMMA RAYS GIVEN OFF BY PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES IF THERE WERE ON AVERAGE PER CUBIC LIGHT YEAR ONE CAN THEREFORE SAY THAT THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE GAMMA RAY BACKGROUND DO NOT PROVIDE ANY POSITIVE EVIDENCE FOR PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES BUT THEY DO TELL US THAT ON AVERAGE THERE CANNOT BE MORE THAN IN EVERY CUBIC LIGHT YEAR IN THE UNIVERSE THIS LIMIT MEANS THAT PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES COULD MAKE UP AT MOST ONE MILLIONTH OF THE MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE WITH PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES BEING SO SCARCE IT MIGHT SEEM UNLIKELY THAT THERE WOULD BE ONE NEAR ENOUGH FOR US TO OBSERVE AS AN INDIVIDUAL SOURCE OF GAMMA RAYS BUT SINCE GRAVITY WOULD DRAW PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES TOWARD ANY MATTER THEY SHOULD BE MUCH MORE COMMON IN AND AROUND GALAXIES SO ALTHOUGH THE GAMMA RAY BACKGROUND TELLS US THAT THERE CAN BE NO MORE THAN PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES PER CUBIC LIGHT YEAR ON AVERAGE IT TELLS US NOTHING ABOUT HOW COMMON THEY MIGHT BE IN OUR OWN GALAXY IF THEY WERE SAY A MILLION TIMES MORE COMMON THAN THIS THEN THE NEAREST BLACK HOLE TO US WOULD PROBABLY BE AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT A THOUSAND MILLION KILOMETERS OR ABOUT AS FAR AWAY AS PLUTO THE FARTHEST KNOWN PLANET AT THIS DISTANCE IT WOULD STILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DETECT THE STEADY EMISSION OF A BLACK HOLE EVEN IF IT WAS TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS IN ORDER TO OBSERVE A PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLE ONE WOULD HAVE TO DETECT SEVERAL GAMMA RAY QUANTA COMING FROM THE SAME DIRECTION WITHIN A REASONABLE SPACE OF TIME SUCH AS A WEEK OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT SIMPLY BE PART OF THE BACKGROUND BUT PLANCKS QUANTUM PRINCIPLE TELLS US THAT EACH GAMMA RAY QUANTUM HAS A VERY HIGH ENERGY BECAUSE GAMMA RAYS HAVE A VERY HIGH FREQUENCY SO IT WOULD NOT TAKE MANY QUANTA TO RADIATE EVEN TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS AND TO OBSERVE THESE FEW COMING FROM THE DISTANCE OF PLUTO WOULD REQUIRE A LARGER GAMMA RAY DETECTOR THAN ANY THAT HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED SO FAR MOREOVER THE DETECTOR WOULD HAVE TO BE IN SPACE BECAUSE GAMMA RAYS CANNOT PENETRATE THE ATMOSPHERE OF COURSE IF A BLACK HOLE AS CLOSE AS PLUTO WERE TO REACH THE END OF ITS LIFE AND BLOW UP IT WOULD BE EASY TO DETECT THE FINAL BURST OF EMISSION BUT IF THE BLACK HOLE HAS BEEN EMITTING FOR THE LAST TEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND MILLION YEARS THE CHANCE OF IT REACHING THE END OF ITS LIFE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS RATHER THAN SEVERAL MILLION YEARS IN THE PAST OR FUTURE IS REALLY RATHER SMALL SO IN ORDER TO HAVE A REASONABLE CHANCE OF SEEING AN EXPLOSION BEFORE YOUR RESEARCH GRANT RAN OUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO DETECT ANY EXPLOSIONS WITHIN A DISTANCE OF ABOUT ONE LIGHTYEAR IN FACT BURSTS OF GAMMA RAYS FROM SPACE HAVE BEEN DETECTED BY SATELLITES ORIGINALLY CONSTRUCTED TO LOOK FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE TEST BAN TREATY THESE SEEM TO OCCUR ABOUT SIXTEEN TIMES A MONTH AND TO BE ROUGHLY UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED IN DIRECTION ACROSS THE SKY THIS INDICATES THAT THEY COME FROM OUTSIDE THE SOLAR SYSTEM SINCE OTHERWISE WE WOULD EXPECT THEM TO BE CONCENTRATED TOWARD THE PLANE OF THE ORBITS OF THE PLANETS THE UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION ALSO INDICATES THAT THE SOURCES ARE EITHER FAIRLY NEAR TO US IN OUR GALAXY OR RIGHT OUTSIDE IT AT COSMOLOGICAL DISTANCES BECAUSE OTHERWISE AGAIN THEY WOULD BE CONCENTRATED TOWARD THE PLANE OF THE GALAXY IN THE LATTER CASE THE ENERGY REQUIRED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE BURSTS WOULD BE FAR TOO HIGH TO HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY TINY BLACK HOLES BUT IF THE SOURCES WERE CLOSE IN GALACTIC TERMS IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE THAT THEY WERE EXPLODING BLACK HOLES I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE THIS TO BE THE CASE BUT I HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE OTHER POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR THE GAMMA RAY BURSTS SUCH AS COLLIDING NEUTRON STARS NEW OBSERVATIONS IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS PARTICULARLY BY GRAVITATIONAL WAVE DETECTORS LIKE LIGO SHOULD ENABLE US TO DISCOVER THE ORIGIN OF THE GAMMA RAY BURSTS EVEN IF THE SEARCH FOR PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES PROVES NEGATIVE AS IT SEEMS IT MAY IT WILL STILL GIVE US IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF THE UNIVERSE IF THE EARLY UNIVERSE HAD BEEN CHAOTIC OR IRREGULAR OR IF THE PRESSURE OF MATTER HAD BEEN LOW ONE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IT TO PRODUCE MANY MORE PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES THAN THE LIMIT ALREADY SET BY OUR OBSERVATIONS OF THE GAMMA RAY BACKGROUND ONLY IF THE EARLY UNIVERSE WAS VERY SMOOTH AND UNIFORM WITH A HIGH PRESSURE CAN ONE EXPLAIN THE ABSENCE OF OBSERVABLE NUMBERS OF PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES THE IDEA OF RADIATION FROM BLACK HOLES WAS THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF A PREDICTION THAT DEPENDED IN AN ESSENTIAL WAY ON BOTH THE GREAT THEORIES OF THIS CENTURY GENERAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS IT AROUSED A LOT OF OPPOSITION INITIALLY BECAUSE IT UPSET THE EXISTING VIEWPOINT HOW CAN A BLACK HOLE EMIT ANYTHING WHEN I FIRST ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS OF MY CALCULATIONS AT A CONFERENCE AT THE RUTHERFORDAPPLETON LABORATORY NEAR OXFORD I WAS GREETED WITH GENERAL INCREDULITY AT THE END OF MY TALK THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SESSION JOHN G TAYLOR FROM KINGS COLLEGE LONDON CLAIMED IT WAS ALL NONSENSE HE EVEN WROTE A PAPER TO THAT EFFECT HOWEVER IN THE END MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING JOHN TAYLOR HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT BLACK HOLES MUST RADIATE LIKE HOT BODIES IF OUR OTHER IDEAS ABOUT GENERAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS ARE CORRECT THUS EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET MANAGED TO FIND A PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLE THERE IS FAIRLY GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT IF WE DID IT WOULD HAVE TO BE EMITTING A LOT OF GAMMA RAYS AND X RAYS THE EXISTENCE OF RADIATION FROM BLACK HOLES SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE IS NOT AS FINAL AND IRREVERSIBLE AS WE ONCE THOUGHT IF AN ASTRONAUT FALLS INTO A BLACK HOLE ITS MASS WILL INCREASE BUT EVENTUALLY THE ENERGY EQUIVALENT OF THAT EXTRA MASS WILL BE RETURNED TO THE UNIVERSE IN THE FORM OF RADIATION THUS IN A SENSE THE ASTRONAUT WILL BE RECYCLED IT WOULD BE A POOR SORT OF IMMORTALITY HOWEVER BECAUSE ANY PERSONAL CONCEPT OF TIME FOR THE ASTRONAUT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY COME TO AN END AS HE WAS TORN APART INSIDE THE BLACK HOLE EVEN THE TYPES OF PARTICLES THAT WERE EVENTUALLY EMITTED BY THE BLACK HOLE WOULD IN GENERAL BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE THAT MADE UP THE ASTRONAUT THE ONLY FEATURE OF THE ASTRONAUT THAT WOULD SURVIVE WOULD BE HIS MASS OR ENERGY THE APPROXIMATIONS I USED TO DERIVE THE EMISSION FROM BLACK HOLES SHOULD WORK WELL WHEN THE BLACK HOLE HAS A MASS GREATER THAN A FRACTION OF A GRAM HOWEVER THEY WILL BREAK DOWN AT THE END OF THE BLACK HOLES LIFE WHEN ITS MASS GETS VERY SMALL THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME SEEMS TO BE THAT THE BLACK HOLE WILL JUST DISAPPEAR AT LEAST FROM OUR REGION OF THE UNIVERSE TAKING WITH IT THE ASTRONAUT AND ANY SINGULARITY THERE MIGHT BE INSIDE IT IF INDEED THERE IS ONE THIS WAS THE FIRST INDICATION THAT QUANTUM MECHANICS MIGHT REMOVE THE SINGULARITIES THAT WERE PREDICTED BY GENERAL RELATIVITY HOWEVER THE METHODS THAT I AND OTHER PEOPLE WERE USING IN WERE NOT ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SUCH AS WHETHER SINGULARITIES WOULD OCCUR IN QUANTUM GRAVITY FROM ONWARD I THEREFORE STARTED TO DEVELOP A MORE POWERFUL APPROACH TO QUANTUM GRAVITY BASED ON RICHARD FEYNRNANS IDEA OF A SUM OVER HISTORIES THE ANSWERS THAT THIS APPROACH SUGGESTS FOR THE ORIGIN AND FATE OF THE UNIVERSE AND ITS CONTENTS SUCH AS ASTRONAUTS WILL BE DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT TWO CHAPTERS WE SHALL SEE THAT ALTHOUGH THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE PLACES LIMITATIONS ON THE ACCURACY OF ALL OUR PREDICTIONS IT MAY AT THE SAME TIME REMOVE THE FUNDAMENTAL UNPREDICTABILITY THAT OCCURS AT A SPACETIME SINGULARITY OF MASS AND ENERGY IN IT BODIES LIKE THE EARTH ARE NOT MADE TO MOVE ON CURVED ORBITS BY A FORCE CALLED GRAVITY INSTEAD THEY FOLLOW THE NEAREST THING TO A STRAIGHT PATH IN A CURVED SPACE WHICH IS CALLED A GEODESIC A GEODESIC IS THE SHORTEST OR LONGEST PATH BETWEEN TWO NEARBY POINTS FOR EXAMPLE THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IS A TWODIMENSIONAL CURVED SPACE A GEODESIC ON THE EARTH IS CALLED A GREAT CIRCLE AND IS THE SHORTEST ROUTE BETWEEN TWO POINTS FIG AS THE GEODESIC IS THE SHORTEST PATH BETWEEN ANY TWO AIRPORTS THIS IS THE ROUTE AN AIRLINE NAVIGATOR WILL TELL THE PILOT TO FLY ALONG IN GENERAL RELATIVITY BODIES ALWAYS FOLLOW STRAIGHT LINES IN FOURDIMENSIONAL SPACETIME BUT THEY NEVERTHELESS APPEAR TO US TO MOVE ALONG CURVED PATHS IN OUR THREEDIMENSIONAL SPACE THIS IS RATHER LIKE WATCHING AN AIRPLANE FLYING OVER HILLY GROUND ALTHOUGH IT FOLLOWS A STRAIGHT LINE IN THREEDIMENSIONAL SPACE ITS SHADOW FOLLOWS A CURVED PATH ON THE TWODIMENSIONAL GROUND THE MASS OF THE SUN CURVES SPACETIME IN SUCH A WAY THAT ALTHOUGH THE EARTH FOLLOWS A STRAIGHT PATH IN FOURDIMENSIONAL SPACETIME IT APPEARS TO US TO MOVE ALONG A CIRCULAR ORBIT IN THREEDIMENSIONAL SPACE FACT THE ORBITS OF THE PLANETS PREDICTED BY GENERAL RELATIVITY ARE ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME AS THOSE PREDICTED BY THE NEWTONIAN THEORY OF GRAVITY HOWEVER IN THE CASE OF MERCURY WHICH BEING THE NEAREST PLANET TO THE SUN FEELS THE STRONGEST GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS AND HAS A RATHER ELONGATED ORBIT GENERAL RELATIVITY PREDICTS THAT THE LONG AXIS OF THE ELLIPSE SHOULD ROTATE ABOUT THE SUN AT A RATE OF ABOUT ONE DEGREE IN TEN THOUSAND YEARS SMALL THOUGH THIS EFFECT IS IT HAD BEEN NOTICED BEFORE AND SERVED AS ONE OF THE FIRST CONFIRMATIONS OF EINSTEINS THEORY IN RECENT YEARS THE EVEN SMALLER DEVIATIONS OF THE ORBITS OF THE OTHER PLANETS FROM THE NEWTONIAN PREDICTIONS HAVE BEEN MEASURED BY RADAR AND FOUND TO AGREE WITH THE PREDICTIONS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY LIGHT RAYS TOO MUST FOLLOW GEODESICS IN SPACETIME AGAIN THE FACT THAT SPACE IS CURVED MEANS THAT LIGHT NO LONGER APPEARS TO TRAVEL IN STRAIGHT LINES IN SPACE SO GENERAL RELATIVITY PREDICTS THAT LIGHT SHOULD BE BENT BY GRAVITATIONAL FIELDS FOR EXAMPLE THE THEORY PREDICTS THAT THE LIGHT CONES OF POINTS NEAR THE SUN WOULD BE SLIGHTLY BENT INWARD ON ACCOUNT OF THE MASS OF THE SUN THIS MEANS THAT LIGHT FROM A DISTANT STAR THAT HAPPENED TO PASS NEAR THE SUN WOULD BE DEFLECTED THROUGH A SMALL ANGLE CAUSING THE STAR TO APPEAR IN A DIFFERENT POSITION TO AN OBSERVER ON THE EARTH FIG OF COURSE IF THE LIGHT FROM THE STAR ALWAYS PASSED CLOSE TO THE SUN WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TELL WHETHER THE LIGHT WAS BEING DEFLECTED OR IF INSTEAD THE STAR WAS REALLY WHERE WE SEE IT HOWEVER AS THE EARTH ORBITS AROUND THE SUN DIFFERENT STARS APPEAR TO PASS BEHIND THE SUN AND HAVE THEIR LIGHT DEFLECTED THEY THEREFORE CHANGE THEIR APPARENT POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER STARS IT IS NORMALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THIS EFFECT BECAUSE THE LIGHT FROM THE SUN MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO OBSERVE STARS THAT APPEAR NEAR TO THE SUN THE SKY HOWEVER IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO SO DURING AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN WHEN THE SUNS LIGHT IS BLOCKED OUT BY THE MOON EINSTEINS PREDICTION OF LIGHT DEFLECTION COULD NOT BE TESTED IMMEDIATELY IN BECAUSE THE FIRST WORLD WAR WAS IN PROGRESS AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THAT A BRITISH EXPEDITION OBSERVING AN ECLIPSE FROM WEST AFRICA SHOWED THAT LIGHT WAS INDEED DEFLECTED BY THE SUN JUST AS PREDICTED BY THE THEORY THIS PROOF OF A GERMAN THEORY BY BRITISH SCIENTISTS WAS HAILED AS A GREAT ACT OF RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AFTER THE WAR IT IS IONIC THEREFORE THAT LATER EXAMINATION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN ON THAT EXPEDITION SHOWED THE ERRORS WERE AS GREAT AS THE EFFECT THEY WERE TRYING TO MEASURE THEIR MEASUREMENT HAD BEEN SHEER LUCK OR A CASE OF KNOWING THE RESULT THEY WANTED TO GET NOT AN UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE IN SCIENCE THE LIGHT DEFLECTION HAS HOWEVER BEEN ACCURATELY CONFIRMED BY A NUMBER OF LATER OBSERVATIONS ANOTHER PREDICTION OF GENERAL RELATIVITY IS THAT TIME SHOULD APPEAR TO SLOWER NEAR A MASSIVE BODY LIKE THE EARTH THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS A RELATION BETWEEN THE ENERGY OF LIGHT AND ITS FREQUENCY THAT IS THE NUMBER OF WAVES OF LIGHT PER SECOND THE GREATER THE ENERGY THE HIGHER FREQUENCY AS LIGHT TRAVELS UPWARD IN THE EARTHS GRAVITATIONAL FIELD IT LOSES ENERGY AND SO ITS FREQUENCY GOES DOWN THIS MEANS THAT THE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN ONE WAVE CREST AND THE NEXT GOES UP TO SOMEONE HIGH UP IT WOULD APPEAR THAT EVERYTHING DOWN BELOW WAS MAKING LONGER TO HAPPEN THIS PREDICTION WAS TESTED IN USING A PAIR OF VERY ACCURATE CLOCKS MOUNTED AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF A WATER TOWER THE CLOCK AT THE BOTTOM WHICH WAS NEARER THE EARTH WAS FOUND TO RUN SLOWER IN EXACT AGREEMENT WITH GENERAL RELATIVITY THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SPEED OF CLOCKS AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS ABOVE THE EARTH IS NOW OF CONSIDERABLE PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE WITH THE ADVENT OF VERY ACCURATE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS BASED ON SIGNALS FROM SATELLITES IF ONE IGNORED THE PREDICTIONS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY THE POSITION THAT ONE CALCULATED WOULD BE WRONG BY SEVERAL MILES NEWTONS LAWS OF MOTION PUT AN END TO THE IDEA OF ABSOLUTE POSITION IN SPACE THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY GETS RID OF ABSOLUTE TIME CONSIDER A PAIR OF TWINS SUPPOSE THAT ONE TWIN GOES TO LIVE ON THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN WHILE THE OTHER STAYS AT SEA LEVEL THE FIRST TWIN WOULD AGE FASTER THAN THE SECOND THUS IF THEY MET AGAIN ONE WOULD BE OLDER THAN THE OTHER IN THIS CASE THE DIFFERENCE IN AGES WOULD BE VERY SMALL BUT IT WOULD BE MUCH LARGER IF ONE OF THE TWINS WENT FOR A LONG TRIP IN A SPACESHIP AT NEARLY THE SPEED OF LIGHT WHEN HE RETURNED HE WOULD BE MUCH YOUNGER THAN THE ONE WHO STAYED ON EARTH THIS IS KNOWN AS THE TWINS PARADOX BUT IT IS A PARADOX ONLY IF ONE HAS THE IDEA OF ABSOLUTE TIME AT THE BACK OF ONES MIND IN THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY THERE IS NO UNIQUE ABSOLUTE TIME BUT INSTEAD EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS HIS OWN PERSONAL MEASURE OF TIME THAT DEPENDS ON WHERE HE IS AND HOW HE IS MOVING BEFORE SPACE AND TIME WERE THOUGHT OF AS A FIXED ARENA IN WHICH EVENTS TOOK PLACE BUT WHICH WAS NOT AFFECTED BY WHAT HAPPENED IN IT THIS WAS TRUE EVEN OF THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY BODIES MOVED FORCES ATTRACTED AND REPELLED BUT TIME AND SPACE SIMPLY CONTINUED UNAFFECTED IT WAS NATURAL TO THINK THAT SPACE AND TIME WENT ON FOREVER THE SITUATION HOWEVER IS QUITE DIFFERENT IN THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY SPACE AND TIME ARE NOW DYNAMIC QUANTITIES WHEN A BODY MOVES OR A FORCE ACTS IT AFFECTS THE CURVATURE OF SPACE AND TIME AND IN TURN THE STRUCTURE OF SPACETIME AFFECTS THE WAY IN WHICH BODIES MOVE AND FORCES ACT SPACE AND TIME NOT ONLY AFFECT BUT ALSO ARE AFFECTED BY EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE UNIVERSE JUST AS ONE CANNOT TALK ABOUT EVENTS IN THE UNIVERSE WITHOUT THE NOTIONS OF SPACE AND TIME SO IN GENERAL RELATIVITY IT BECAME MEANINGLESS TO TALK ABOUT SPACE AND TIME OUTSIDE THE LIMITS OF THE UNIVERSE IN THE FOLLOWING DECADES THIS NEW UNDERSTANDING OF SPACE AND TIME WAS TO REVOLUTIONIZE OUR VIEW OF THE UNIVERSE THE OLD IDEA OF AN ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGING UNIVERSE THAT COULD HAVE EXISTED AND COULD CONTINUE TO EXIST FOREVER WAS REPLACED BY THE NOTION OF A DYNAMIC EXPANDING UNIVERSE THAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEGUN A FINITE TIME AGO AND THAT MIGHT END AT A FINITE TIME IN THE FUTURE THAT REVOLUTION FORMS THE SUBJECT OF THE NEXT CHAPTER AND YEARS LATER IT WAS ALSO TO BE THE STARTING POINT FOR MY WORK IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS ROGER PENROSE AND I SHOWED THAT EINSTEINS GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY IMPLIED THAT THE UNIVERSE MUST HAVE A BEGINNING AND POSSIBLY AN END IF ONE LOOKS AT THE SKY ON A CLEAR MOONLESS NIGHT THE BRIGHTEST OBJECTS ONE SEES ARE LIKELY TO BE THE PLANETS VENUS MARS JUPITER AND SATURN THERE WILL ALSO BE A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF STARS WHICH ARE JUST LIKE OUR OWN SUN BUT MUCH FARTHER FROM US SOME OF THESE FIXED STARS DO IN FACT APPEAR TO CHANGE VERY SLIGHTLY THEIR POSITIONS RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER AS EARTH ORBITS AROUND THE SUN THEY ARE NOT REALLY FIXED AT ALL THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPARATIVELY NEAR TO US AS THE EARTH GOES ROUND THE SUN WE SEE THEM FROM DIFFERENT POSITIONS AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF MORE DISTANT STARS THIS IS FORTUNATE BECAUSE IT ENABLES US TO MEASURE DIRECTLY THE DISTANCE OF THESE STARS FROM US THE NEARER THEY ARE THE MORE THEY APPEAR TO MOVE THE NEAREST STAR CALLED PROXIMA CENTAURI IS FOUND TO BE ABOUT FOUR LIGHTYEARS AWAY THE LIGHT FROM IT TAKES ABOUT FOUR YEARS TO REACH EARTH OR ABOUT TWENTYTHREE MILLION MILLION MILES MOST OF THE OTHER STARS THAT ARE VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE LIE WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED LIGHTYEARS OF US OUR SUN FOR COMPARISON IS A MERE LIGHTMINUTES AWAY THE VISIBLE STARS APPEAR SPREAD ALL OVER THE NIGHT SKY BUT ARE PARTICULARLY CONCENTRATED IN ONE BAND WHICH WE CALL THE MILKY WAY AS LONG AGO AS SOME ASTRONOMERS WERE SUGGESTING THAT THE APPEARANCE OF THE MILKY WAY COULD BE EXPLAINED IF MOST OF THE VISIBLE STARS LIE IN A SINGLE DISKLIKE CONFIGURATION ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE NOW CALL A SPIRAL GALAXY ONLY A FEW DECADES LATER THE ASTRONOMER SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL CONFIRMED THIS IDEA BY PAINSTAKINGLY CATALOGING THE POSITIONS AND DISTANCES OF VAST NUMBERS OF STARS EVEN SO THE IDEA GAINED COMPLETE ACCEPTANCE ONLY EARLY THIS CENTURY OUR MODERN PICTURE OF THE UNIVERSE DATES BACK TO ONLY WHEN THE AMERICAN ASTRONOMER EDWIN HUBBLE DEMONSTRATED THAT OURS WAS NOT THE ONLY GALAXY THERE WERE IN FACT MANY OTHERS WITH VAST TRACTS OF EMPTY SPACE BETWEEN THEM IN ORDER TO PROVE THIS HE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE DISTANCES TO THESE OTHER GALAXIES WHICH ARE SO FAR AWAY THAT UNLIKE NEARBY STARS THEY REALLY DO APPEAR FIXED HUBBLE WAS FORCED THEREFORE TO USE INDIRECT METHODS TO MEASURE THE DISTANCES NOW THE APPARENT BRIGHTNESS OF A STAR DEPENDS ON TWO FACTORS HOW MUCH LIGHT IT RADIATES ITS LUMINOSITY AND HOW FAR IT IS FROM US FOR NEARBY STARS WE CAN MEASURE THEIR APPARENT BRIGHTNESS AND THEIR DISTANCE AND SO WE CAN WORK OUT THEIR LUMINOSITY CONVERSELY IF WE KNEW THE LUMINOSITY OF STARS IN OTHER GALAXIES WE COULD WORK OUT THEIR DISTANCE BY MEASURING THEIR APPARENT BRIGHTNESS HUBBLE NOTED THAT CERTAIN TYPES OF STARS ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME LUMINOSITY WHEN THEY ARE NEAR ENOUGH FOR US TO MEASURE THEREFORE HE ARGUED IF WE FOUND SUCH STARS IN ANOTHER GALAXY WE COULD ASSUME THAT THEY HAD THE SAME LUMINOSITY AND SO CALCULATE THE DISTANCE TO THAT GALAXY IF WE COULD DO THIS FOR A NUMBER OF STARS IN THE SAME GALAXY AND OUR CALCULATIONS ALWAYS GAVE THE SAME DISTANCE WE COULD BE FAIRLY CONFIDENT OF OUR ESTIMATE IN THIS WAY EDWIN HUBBLE WORKED OUT THE DISTANCES TO NINE DIFFERENT GALAXIES WE NOW KNOW THAT OUR GALAXY IS ONLY ONE OF SOME HUNDRED THOUSAND MILLION THAT CAN BE SEEN USING MODERN TELESCOPES EACH GALAXY ITSELF CONTAINING SOME HUNDRED THOUSAND MILLION STARS FIGURE SHOWS A PICTURE OF ONE SPIRAL GALAXY THAT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE THINK OURS MUST LOOK LIKE TO SOMEONE LIVING IN ANOTHER GALAXY WE LIVE IN A GALAXY THAT IS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND LIGHTYEARS ACROSS AND IS SLOWLY ROTATING THE STARS IN ITS SPIRAL ARMS ORBIT AROUND ITS CENTER ABOUT ONCE EVERY SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION YEARS OUR SUN IS JUST AN ORDINARY AVERAGESIZED YELLOW STAR NEAR THE INNER EDGE OF ONE OF THE SPIRAL ARMS WE HAVE CERTAINLY COME A LONG WAY SINCE ARISTOTLE AND PTOLEMY WHEN THOUGHT THAT THE EARTH WAS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE STARS ARE SO FAR AWAY THAT THEY APPEAR TO US TO BE JUST PINPOINTS OF LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE THEIR SIZE OR SHAPE SO HOW CAN WE TELL DIFFERENT TYPES OF STARS APART FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF STARS THERE IS ONLY ONE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE THAT WE CAN OBSERVE THE COLOR OF THEIR LIGHT NEWTON DISCOVERED THAT IF LIGHT FROM THE SUN PASSES THROUGH A TRIANGULARSHAPED PIECE OF GLASS CALLED A PRISM IT BREAKS UP INTO ITS COMPONENT COLORS ITS SPECTRUM AS IN A RAINBOW BY FOCUSING A TELESCOPE ON AN INDIVIDUAL STAR OR GALAXY ONE CAN SIMILARLY OBSERVE THE SPECTRUM OF THE LIGHT FROM THAT STAR OR GALAXY DIFFERENT STARS HAVE DIFFERENT SPECTRA BUT THE RELATIVE BRIGHTNESS OF THE DIFFERENT COLORS IS ALWAYS EXACTLY WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT TO FIND IN THE LIGHT EMITTED BY AN OBJECT THAT IS GLOWING RED HOT IN FACT THE LIGHT EMITTED BY ANY OPAQUE OBJECT THAT IS GLOWING RED HOT HAS A CHARACTERISTIC SPECTRUM THAT DEPENDS ONLY ON ITS TEMPERATURE A THERMAL SPECTRUM THIS MEANS THAT WE CAN TELL A STARS TEMPERATURE FROM THE SPECTRUM OF ITS LIGHT MOREOVER WE FIND THAT CERTAIN VERY SPECIFIC COLORS ARE MISSING FROM STARS SPECTRA AND THESE MISSING COLORS MAY VARY FROM STAR TO STAR SINCE WE KNOW THAT EACH CHEMICAL ELEMENT ABSORBS A CHARACTERISTIC SET OF VERY SPECIFIC COLORS BY MATCHING THESE TO THOSE THAT ARE MISSING FROM A STARS SPECTRUM WE CAN DETERMINE EXACTLY WHICH ELEMENTS ARE PRESENT IN THE STARS ATMOSPHERE IN THE S WHEN ASTRONOMERS BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE SPECTRA OF STARS IN OTHER GALAXIES THEY FOUND SOMETHING MOST PECULIAR THERE WERE THE SAME CHARACTERISTIC SETS OF MISSING COLORS AS FOR STARS IN OUR OWN GALAXY BUT THEY WERE ALL SHIFTED BY THE SAME RELATIVE AMOUNT TOWARD THE RED END OF THE SPECTRUM TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WE MUST FIRST UNDERSTAND THE DOPPLER EFFECT AS WE HAVE SEEN VISIBLE LIGHT CONSISTS OF FLUCTUATIONS OR WAVES IN THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD THE WAVELENGTH OR DISTANCE FROM ONE WAVE CREST TO THE NEXT OF LIGHT IS EXTREMELY SMALL RANGING FROM FOUR TO SEVEN TENMILLIONTHS OF A METER THE DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT ARE WHAT THE HUMAN EYE SEES AS DIFFERENT COLORS WITH THE LONGEST WAVELENGTHS APPEARING AT THE RED END OF THE SPECTRUM AND THE SHORTEST WAVELENGTHS AT THE BLUE END NOW IMAGINE A SOURCE OF LIGHT AT A CONSTANT DISTANCE FROM US SUCH AS A STAR EMITTING WAVES OF LIGHT AT A CONSTANT WAVELENGTH OBVIOUSLY THE WAVELENGTH OF THE WAVES WE RECEIVE WILL BE THE SAME AS THE WAVELENGTH AT WHICH THEY ARE EMITTED THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD OF THE GALAXY WILL NOT BE LARGE ENOUGH TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT SUPPOSE NOW THAT THE SOURCE STARTS MOVING TOWARD US WHEN THE SOURCE EMITS THE NEXT WAVE CREST IT WILL BE NEARER TO US SO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN WAVE CRESTS WILL BE SMALLER THAN WHEN THE STAR WAS STATIONARY THIS MEANS THAT THE WAVELENGTH OF THE WAVES WE RECEIVE IS SHORTER THAN WHEN THE STAR WAS STATIONARY CORRESPONDINGLY IF THE SOURCE IS MOVING AWAY FROM US THE WAVELENGTH OF THE WAVES WE RECEIVE WILL BE LONGER IN THE CASE OF LIGHT THEREFORE MEANS THAT STARS MOVING AWAY FROM US WILL HAVE THEIR SPECTRA SHIFTED TOWARD THE RED END OF THE SPECTRUM REDSHIFTED AND THOSE MOVING TOWARD US WILL HAVE THEIR SPECTRA BLUESHIFTED THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WAVELENGTH AND SPEED WHICH IS CALLED THE DOPPLER EFFECT IS AN EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE LISTEN TO A CAR PASSING ON THE ROAD AS THE CAR IS APPROACHING ITS ENGINE SOUNDS AT A HIGHER PITCH CORRESPONDING TO A SHORTER WAVELENGTH AND HIGHER FREQUENCY OF SOUND WAVES AND WHEN IT PASSES AND GOES AWAY IT SOUNDS AT A LOWER PITCH THE BEHAVIOR OF LIGHT OR RADIO WAVES IS SIMILAR INDEED THE POLICE MAKE USE OF THE DOPPLER EFFECT TO MEASURE THE SPEED OF CARS BY MEASURING THE WAVELENGTH OF PULSES OF RADIO WAVES REFLECTED OFF THEM LN THE YEARS FOLLOWING HIS PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF OTHER GALAXIES RUBBLE SPENT HIS TIME CATALOGING THEIR DISTANCES AND OBSERVING THEIR SPECTRA AT THAT TIME MOST PEOPLE EXPECTED THE GALAXIES TO BE MOVING AROUND QUITE RANDOMLY AND SO EXPECTED TO FIND AS MANY BLUESHIFTED SPECTRA AS REDSHIFTED ONES IT WAS QUITE A SURPRISE THEREFORE TO FIND THAT MOST GALAXIES APPEARED REDSHIFTED NEARLY ALL WERE MOVING AWAY FROM US MORE SURPRISING STILL WAS THE FINDING THAT HUBBLE PUBLISHED IN EVEN THE SIZE OF A GALAXYS RED SHIFT IS NOT RANDOM BUT IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE GALAXYS DISTANCE FROM US OR IN OTHER WORDS THE FARTHER A GALAXY IS THE FASTER IT IS MOVING AWAY AND THAT MEANT THAT THE UNIVERSE COULD NOT BE STATIC AS EVERYONE PREVIOUSLY HAD THOUGHT IS IN FACT EXPANDING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT GALAXIES IS CHANGING ALL THE TIME THE DISCOVERY THAT THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING WAS ONE OF THE GREAT INTELLECTUAL REVOLUTIONS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH HINDSIGHT IT IS EASY WONDER WHY NO ONE HAD THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE NEWTON AND OTHERS SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT A STATIC UNIVERSE WOULD SOON START TO CONTRACT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GRAVITY BUT SUPPOSE INSTEAD THAT THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING IF IT WAS EXPANDING FAIRLY SLOWLY THE FORCE OF GRAVITY WOULD CAUSE IT EVENTUALLY TO STOP EXPANDING AND THEN TO START CONTRACTING HOWEVER IF IT WAS EXPANDING AT MORE THAN A CERTAIN CRITICAL RATE GRAVITY WOULD NEVER BE STRONG ENOUGH TO STOP IT AND THE UNIVERSE WOULD CONTINUE TO EXPAND FOREVER THIS IS A BIT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE FIRES A ROCKET UPWARD FROM THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IF IT HAS A FAIRLY LOW SPEED GRAVITY WILL EVENTUALLY STOP THE ROCKET AND IT WILL START FALLING BACK ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE ROCKET HAS MORE THAN A CERTAIN CRITICAL SPEED ABOUT SEVEN MILES PER SECOND GRAVITY WILL NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL IT BACK SO IT WILL KEEP GOING AWAY FROM THE EARTH FOREVER THIS BEHAVIOR OF THE UNIVERSE COULD HAVE BEEN PREDICTED FROM NEWTONS THEORY OF GRAVITY AT ANY TIME IN THE NINETEENTH THE EIGHTEENTH OR EVEN THE LATE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY YET SO STRONG WAS THE BELIEF IN A STATIC UNIVERSE THAT IT PERSISTED INTO THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY EVEN EINSTEIN WHEN HE FORMULATED THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY IN WAS SO SURE THAT THE UNIVERSE HAD TO BE STATIC THAT HE MODIFIED HIS THEORY TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE INTRODUCING A SOCALLED COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT INTO HIS EQUATIONS EINSTEIN INTRODUCED A NEW ANTIGRAVITY FORCE WHICH UNLIKE OTHER FORCES DID NOT COME FROM ANY PARTICULAR SOURCE BUT WAS BUILT INTO THE VERY FABRIC OF SPACETIME HE CLAIMED THAT SPACETIME HAD AN INBUILT TENDENCY TO EXPAND AND THIS COULD BE MADE TO BALANCE EXACTLY THE ATTRACTION OF ALL THE MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE SO THAT A STATIC UNIVERSE WOULD RESULT ONLY ONE MAN IT SEEMS WAS WILLING TO TAKE GENERAL RELATIVITY AT FACE VALUE AND WHILE EINSTEIN AND OTHER PHYSICISTS WERE LOOKING FOR WAYS OF AVOIDING GENERAL RELATIVITYS PREDICTION OF A NONSTATIC UNIVERSE THE RUSSIAN PHYSICIST AND MATHEMATICIAN ALEXANDER FRIEDMANN INSTEAD SET ABOUT EXPLAINING IT FRIEDMANN MADE TWO VERY SIMPLE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE UNIVERSE THAT THE UNIVERSE LOOKS IDENTICAL IN WHICHEVER DIRECTION WE LOOK AND THAT THIS WOULD ALSO BE TRUE IF WE WERE OBSERVING THE UNIVERSE FROM ANYWHERE ELSE FROM THESE TWO IDEAS ALONE FRIEDMANN SHOWED THAT WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT THE UNIVERSE TO BE STATIC IN FACT IN SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE EDWIN HUBBLES DISCOVERY FRIEDMANN PREDICTED EXACTLY WHAT HUBBLE FOUND THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE UNIVERSE LOOKS THE SAME IN EVERY DIRECTION IS CLEARLY NOT TRUE IN REALITY FOR EXAMPLE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE OTHER STARS IN OUR GALAXY FORM A DISTINCT BAND OF LIGHT ACROSS THE NIGHT SKY CALLED THE MILKY WAY BUT IF WE LOOK AT DISTANT GALAXIES THERE SEEMS TO BE MORE OR LESS THE SAME NUMBER OF THEM SO THE UNIVERSE DOES SEEM TO BE ROUGHLY THE SAME IN EVERY DIRECTION PROVIDED ONE VIEWS IT ON A LARGE SCALE COMPARED TO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN GALAXIES AND IGNORES THE DIFFERENCES ON SMALL SCALES FOR A LONG TIME THIS WAS SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION FOR FRIEDMANNS ASSUMPTION AS A ROUGH APPROXIMATION TO THE REAL UNIVERSE BUT MORE RECENTLY A LUCKY ACCIDENT UNCOVERED THE FACT THAT FRIEDMANNS ASSUMPTION IS IN FACT A REMARKABLY ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF OUR UNIVERSE IN TWO AMERICAN PHYSICISTS AT THE BELL TELEPHONE LABORATORIES IN NEW JERSEY ARNO PENZIAS AND ROBERT WILSON WERE TESTING A VERY SENSITIVE MICROWAVE DETECTOR MICROWAVES ARE JUST LIKE LIGHT WAVES BUT WITH A WAVELENGTH OF AROUND A CENTIMETER PENZIAS AND WILSON WERE WORRIED WHEN THEY FOUND THAT THEIR DETECTOR WAS PICKING UP MORE NOISE THAN IT OUGHT TO THE NOISE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE COMING FROM ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION FIRST THEY DISCOVERED BIRD DROPPINGS IN THEIR DETECTOR AND CHECKED FOR OTHER POSSIBLE MALFUNCTIONS BUT SOON RULED THESE OUT THEY KNEW THAT ANY NOISE FROM WITHIN THE ATMOSPHERE WOULD BE STRONGER WHEN THE DETECTOR WAS NOT POINTING STRAIGHT UP THAN WHEN IT WAS BECAUSE LIGHT RAYS TRAVEL THROUGH MUCH MORE ATMOSPHERE WHEN RECEIVED FROM NEAR THE HORIZON THAN WHEN RECEIVED FROM DIRECTLY OVERHEAD THE EXTRA NOISE WAS THE SAME WHICHEVER DIRECTION THE DETECTOR WAS POINTED SO IT MUST COME FROM OUTSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE IT WAS ALSO THE SAME DAY AND NIGHT AND THROUGHOUT THE YEAR EVEN THOUGH THE EARTH WAS ROTATING ON ITS AXIS AND ORBITING AROUND THE SUN THIS SHOWED THAT THE RADIATION MUST COME FROM BEYOND THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND EVEN FROM BEYOND THE GALAXY AS OTHERWISE IT WOULD VARY AS THE MOVEMENT OF EARTH POINTED THE DETECTOR IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS IN FACT WE KNOW THAT THE RADIATION MUST HAVE TRAVELED TO US ACROSS MOST OF THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE AND SINCE IT APPEARS TO BE THE SAME IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THE UNIVERSE MUST ALSO BE THE SAME IN EVERY DIRECTION IF ONLY ON A LARGE SCALE WE NOW KNOW THAT WHICHEVER DIRECTION WE LOOK THIS NOISE NEVER VARIES BY MORE THAN A TINY FRACTION SO PENZIAS AND WILSON HAD UNWITTINGLY STUMBLED ACROSS A REMARKABLY ACCURATE CONFIRMATION OF FRIEDMANNS FIRST ASSUMPTION HOWEVER BECAUSE THE UNIVERSE IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT ONLY ON AVERAGE ON A LARGE SCALE THE MICROWAVES CANNOT BE EXACTLY THE SAME IN EVERY DIRECTION EITHER THERE HAVE TO BE SLIGHT VARIATIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THESE WERE FIRST DETECTED IN BY THE COSMIC BACKGROUND EXPLORER SATELLITE OR COBE AT A LEVEL OF ABOUT ONE PART IN A HUNDRED THOUSAND SMALL THOUGH THESE VARIATIONS ARE THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT AS WILL BE EXPLAINED IN CHAPTER  AT ROUGHLY THE SAME TIME AS PENZIAS AND WILSON WERE INVESTIGATING NOISE IN THEIR DETECTOR TWO AMERICAN PHYSICISTS AT NEARBY PRINCETON UNIVERSITY BOB DICKE AND JIM PEEBLES WERE ALSO TAKING AN INTEREST IN MICROWAVES THEY WERE WORKING ON A SUGGESTION MADE BY GEORGE GAMOW ONCE A STUDENT OF ALEXANDER FRIEDMANN THAT THE EARLY UNIVERSE SHOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HOT AND DENSE GLOWING WHITE HOT DICKE AND PEEBLES ARGUED THAT WE SHOULD STILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE GLOW OF THE EARLY UNIVERSE BECAUSE LIGHT FROM VERY DISTANT PARTS OF IT WOULD ONLY JUST BE REACHING US NOW HOWEVER THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE MEANT THAT THIS LIGHT SHOULD BE SO GREATLY REDSHIFTED THAT IT WOULD APPEAR TO US NOW AS MICROWAVE RADIATION DICKE AND PEEBLES WERE PREPARING TO LOOK FOR THIS RADIATION WHEN PENZIAS AND WILSON HEARD ABOUT THEIR WORK AND REALIZED THAT THEY HAD ALREADY FOUND IT FOR THIS PENZIAS AND WILSON WERE AWARDED THE NOBEL PRIZE IN WHICH SEEMS A BIT HARD ON DICKE AND PEEBLES NOT TO MENTION GAMOW NOW AT FIRST SIGHT ALL THIS EVIDENCE THAT THE UNIVERSE LOOKS THE SAME WHICHEVER DIRECTION WE LOOK IN MIGHT SEEM TO SUGGEST THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT OUR PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE IN PARTICULAR IT MIGHT SEEM THAT IF WE OBSERVE ALL OTHER GALAXIES TO BE MOVING AWAY FROM US THEN WE MUST BE AT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE THERE IS HOWEVER AN ALTERNATE EXPLANATION THE UNIVERSE MIGHT LOOK THE SAME IN EVERY DIRECTION AS SEEN FROM ANY OTHER GALAXY TOO THIS AS WE HAVE SEEN WAS FRIEDMANNS SECOND ASSUMPTION WE HAVE NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR OR AGAINST THIS ASSUMPTION WE BELIEVE IT ONLY ON GROUNDS OF MODESTY IT WOULD BE MOST REMARKABLE IF THE UNIVERSE LOOKED THE SAME IN EVERY DIRECTION AROUND US BUT NOT AROUND OTHER POINTS IN THE UNIVERSE IN FRIEDMANNS MODEL ALL THE GALAXIES ARE MOVING DIRECTLY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER THE SITUATION IS RATHER LIKE A BALLOON WITH A NUMBER OF SPOTS PAINTED ON IT BEING STEADILY BLOWN UP AS THE BALLOON EXPANDS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN ANY TWO SPOTS INCREASES BUT THERE IS NO SPOT THAT CAN BE SAID TO BE THE CENTER OF THE EXPANSION MOREOVER THE FARTHER APART THE SPOTS ARE THE FASTER THEY WILL BE MOVING APART SIMILARLY IN FRIEDMANNS MODEL THE SPEED AT WHICH ANY TWO GALAXIES ARE MOVING APART IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM SO IT PREDICTED THAT THE RED SHIFT OF A GALAXY SHOULD BE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO ITS DISTANCE FROM US EXACTLY AS HUBBLE FOUND DESPITE THE SUCCESS OF HIS MODEL AND HIS PREDICTION OF HUBBLES OBSERVATIONS FRIEDMANNS WORK REMAINED LARGELY UNKNOWN IN THE WEST UNTIL SIMILAR MODELS WERE DISCOVERED IN BY THE AMERICAN PHYSICIST HOWARD ROBERTSON AND THE BRITISH MATHEMATICIAN ARTHUR WALKER IN RESPONSE TO HUBBLES DISCOVERY OF THE UNIFORM EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE ALTHOUGH FRIEDMANN FOUND ONLY ONE THERE ARE IN FACT THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MODELS THAT OBEY FRIEDMANNS TWO FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS IN THE FIRST KIND WHICH FRIEDMANN FOUND THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING SUFFICIENTLY SLOWLY THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT GALAXIES CAUSES THE EXPANSION TO SLOW DOWN AND EVENTUALLY TO STOP THE GALAXIES THEN START TO MOVE TOWARD EACH OTHER AND THE UNIVERSE CONTRACTS IN THIS CASE THE SEPARATION SHOWN IN FIGURE ALSO STARTS AT ZERO AND INCREASES FOREVER HOWEVER THE SPEED AT WHICH THE GALAXIES ARE MOVING APART GETS SMALLER AND SMALLER ALTHOUGH IT NEVER QUITE REACHES ZERO A REMARKABLE FEATURE OF THE FIRST KIND OF FRIEDMANN MODEL IS THAT IN IT THE UNIVERSE IS NOT INFINITE IN SPACE BUT NEITHER DOES SPACE HAVE ANY BOUNDARY GRAVITY IS SO STRONG THAT SPACE IS BENT ROUND ONTO ITSELF MAKING IT RATHER LIKE THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IF ONE KEEPS TRAVELING IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH ONE NEVER COMES UP AGAINST AN IMPASSABLE BARRIER OR FALLS OVER THE EDGE BUT EVENTUALLY COMES BACK TO WHERE ONE STARTED IN THE FIRST KIND OF FRIEDMANN MODEL SPACE IS JUST LIKE THIS BUT WITH THREE DIMENSIONS INSTEAD OF TWO FOR THE EARTHS SURFACE THE FOURTH DIMENSION TIME IS ALSO FINITE IN EXTENT BUT IT IS LIKE A LINE WITH TWO ENDS OR BOUNDARIES A BEGINNING AND AN END WE SHALL SEE LATER THAT WHEN ONE COMBINES GENERAL RELATIVITY WITH THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR BOTH SPACE AND TIME TO BE FINITE WITHOUT ANY EDGES OR BOUNDARIES THE IDEA THAT ONE COULD GO RIGHT ROUND THE UNIVERSE AND END UP WHERE ONE STARTED MAKES GOOD SCIENCE FICTION BUT IT DOESNT HAVE MUCH PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE BECAUSE IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT THE UNIVERSE WOULD RECOLLAPSE TO ZERO SIZE BEFORE ONE COULD GET ROUND YOU WOULD NEED TO TRAVEL FASTER THAN LIGHT IN ORDER TO END UP WHERE YOU STARTED BEFORE THE UNIVERSE CAME TO AN END AND THAT IS NOT ALLOWED IN THE FIRST KIND OF FRIEDMANN MODEL WHICH EXPANDS AND RECOLLAPSES SPACE IS BENT IN ON ITSELF LIKE THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IT IS THEREFORE FINITE IN EXTENT IN THE SECOND KIND OF MODEL WHICH EXPANDS FOREVER SPACE IS BENT THE OTHER WAY LIKE THE SURFACE OF A SADDLE SO IN THIS CASE SPACE IS INFINITE FINALLY IN THE THIRD KIND OF FRIEDMANN MODEL WITH JUST THE CRITICAL RATE OF EXPANSION SPACE IS FLAT AND THEREFORE IS ALSO INFINITE BUT WHICH FRIEDMANN MODEL DESCRIBES OUR UNIVERSE WILL THE UNIVERSE EVENTUALLY STOP EXPANDING AND START CONTRACTING OR WILL IT EXPAND FOREVER TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION WE NEED TO KNOW THE PRESENT RATE OF EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE AND ITS PRESENT AVERAGE DENSITY IF THE DENSITY IS LESS THAN A CERTAIN CRITICAL VALUE DETERMINED BY THE RATE OF EXPANSION THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION WILL BE TOO WEAK TO HALT THE EXPANSION IF THE DENSITY IS GREATER THAN THE CRITICAL VALUE GRAVITY WILL STOP THE EXPANSION AT SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE AND CAUSE THE UNIVERSE TO RECOLLAPSE WE CAN DETERMINE THE PRESENT RATE OF EXPANSION BY MEASURING THE VELOCITIES AT WHICH OTHER GALAXIES ARE MOVING AWAY FROM US USING THE DOPPLER EFFECT THIS CAN BE DONE VERY ACCURATELY HOWEVER THE DISTANCES TO THE GALAXIES ARE NOT VERY WELL KNOWN BECAUSE WE CAN ONLY MEASURE THEM INDIRECTLY SO ALL WE KNOW IS THAT THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING BY BETWEEN PERCENT AND PERCENT EVERY THOUSAND MILLION YEARS HOWEVER OUR UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE PRESENT AVERAGE DENSITY OF THE UNIVERSE IS EVEN GREATER IF WE ADD UP THE MASSES OF ALL THE STARS THAT WE CAN SEE IN OUR GALAXY AND OTHER GALAXIES THE TOTAL IS LESS THAN ONE HUNDREDTH OF THE AMOUNT REQUIRED TO HALT THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE EVEN FOR THE LOWEST ESTIMATE OF THE RATE OF EXPANSION OUR GALAXY AND OTHER GALAXIES HOWEVER MUST CONTAIN A LARGE AMOUNT OF DARK MATTER THAT WE CANNOT SEE DIRECTLY BUT WHICH WE KNOW MUST BE THERE BECAUSE OF THE INFLUENCE OF ITS GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION ON THE ORBITS OF STARS IN THE GALAXIES MOREOVER MOST GALAXIES ARE FOUND IN CLUSTERS AND WE CAN SIMILARLY INFER THE PRESENCE OF YET MORE DARK MATTER IN BETWEEN THE GALAXIES IN THESE CLUSTERS BY ITS EFFECT ON THE MOTION OF THE GALAXIES WHEN WE ADD UP ALL THIS DARK MATTER WE STILL GET ONLY ABOUT ONE TENTH OF THE AMOUNT REQUIRED TO HALT THE EXPANSION HOWEVER WE CANNOT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME OTHER FORM OF MATTER DISTRIBUTED ALMOST UNIFORMLY THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE THAT WE HAVE NOT YET DETECTED AND THAT MIGHT STILL RAISE THE AVERAGE DENSITY OF THE UNIVERSE UP TO THE CRITICAL VALUE NEEDED TO HALT THE EXPANSION THE PRESENT EVIDENCE THEREFORE SUGGESTS THAT THE UNIVERSE WILL PROBABLY EXPAND FOREVER BUT ALL WE CAN REALLY BE SURE OF IS THAT EVEN IF THE UNIVERSE IS GOING TO RECOLLAPSE IT WONT DO SO FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER TEN THOUSAND MILLION YEARS SINCE IT HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPANDING FOR AT LEAST THAT LONG THIS SHOULD NOT UNDULY WORRY US BY THAT TIME UNLESS WE HAVE COLONIZED BEYOND THE SOLAR SYSTEM MANKIND WILL LONG SINCE HAVE DIED OUT EXTINGUISHED ALONG WITH OUR SUN ALL OF THE FRIEDMANN SOLUTIONS HAVE THE FEATURE THAT AT SOME TIME IN THE PAST BETWEEN TEN AND TWENTY THOUSAND MILLION YEARS AGO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN NEIGHBORING GALAXIES MUST HAVE BEEN ZERO AT THAT TIME WHICH WE CALL THE BIG BANG THE DENSITY OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE CURVATURE OF SPACETIME WOULD HAVE BEEN INFINITE BECAUSE MATHEMATICS CANNOT REALLY HANDLE INFINITE NUMBERS THIS MEANS THAT THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ON WHICH FRIEDMANNS SOLUTIONS ARE BASED PREDICTS THAT THERE IS A POINT IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE THE THEORY ITSELF BREAKS DOWN SUCH A POINT IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT MATHEMATICIANS CALL A SINGULARITY IN FACT ALL OUR THEORIES OF SCIENCE ARE FORMULATED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT SPACETIME IS SMOOTH AND NEARLY FIAT SO THEY BREAK DOWN AT THE BIG BANG SINGULARITY WHERE THE CURVATURE OF SPACETIME IS INFINITE THIS MEANS THAT EVEN IF THERE WERE EVENTS BEFORE THE BIG BANG ONE COULD NOT USE THEM TO DETERMINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AFTERWARD BECAUSE PREDICTABILITY WOULD BREAK DOWN AT THE BIG BANG CORRESPONDINGLY IF AS IS THE CASE WE KNOW ONLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE BIG BANG WE COULD NOT DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENED BEFOREHAND AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED EVENTS BEFORE THE BIG BANG CAN HAVE NO CONSEQUENCES SO THEY SHOULD NOT FORM PART OF A SCIENTIFIC MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE WE SHOULD THEREFORE CUT THEM OUT OF THE MODEL AND SAY THAT TIME HAD A BEGINNING AT THE BIG BANG MANY PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE THE IDEA THAT TIME HAS A BEGINNING PROBABLY BECAUSE IT SMACKS OF DIVINE INTERVENTION THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ON THE OTHER HAND SEIZED ON THE BIG BANG MODEL AND IN OFFICIALLY PRONOUNCED IT TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BIBLE THERE WERE THEREFORE A NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS TO AVOID THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE HAD BEEN A BIG BANG THE PROPOSAL THAT GAINED WIDEST SUPPORT WAS CALLED THE STEADY STATE THEORY IT WAS SUGGESTED IN BY TWO REFUGEES FROM NAZIOCCUPIED AUSTRIA HERMANN BONDI AND THOMAS GOLD TOGETHER WITH A BRITON FRED HOYLE WHO HAD WORKED WITH THEM ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF RADAR DURING THE WAR THE IDEA WAS THAT AS THE GALAXIES MOVED AWAY FROM EACH OTHER NEW GALAXIES WERE CONTINUALLY FORMING IN THE GAPS IN BETWEEN FROM NEW MATTER THAT WAS BEING CONTINUALLY CREATED THE UNIVERSE WOULD THEREFORE LOOK ROUGHLY THE SAME AT ALL TIMES AS WELL AS AT ALL POINTS OF SPACE THE STEADY STATE THEORY REQUIRED A MODIFICATION OF GENERAL RELATIVITY TO ALLOW FOR THE CONTINUAL CREATION OF MATTER BUT THE RATE THAT WAS INVOLVED WAS SO LOW ABOUT ONE PARTICLE PER CUBIC KILOMETER PER YEAR THAT IT WAS NOT IN CONFLICT WITH EXPERIMENT THE THEORY WAS A GOOD SCIENTIFIC THEORY IN THE SENSE DESCRIBED IN CHAPTER IT WAS SIMPLE AND IT MADE DEFINITE PREDICTIONS THAT COULD BE TESTED BY OBSERVATION ONE OF THESE PREDICTIONS WAS THAT THE NUMBER OF GALAXIES OR SIMILAR OBJECTS IN ANY GIVEN VOLUME OF SPACE SHOULD BE THE SAME WHEREVER AND WHENEVER WE LOOK IN THE UNIVERSE IN THE LATE S AND EARLY  S A SURVEY OF SOURCES OF RADIO WAVES FROM OUTER SPACE WAS CARRIED OUT AT CAMBRIDGE BY A GROUP OF ASTRONOMERS LED BY MARTIN RYLE WHO HAD ALSO WORKED WITH BONDI GOLD AND HOYLE ON RADAR DURING THE WAR THE CAMBRIDGE GROUP SHOWED THAT MOST OF THESE RADIO SOURCES MUST LIE OUTSIDE OUR GALAXY INDEED MANY OF THEM COULD BE IDENTIFIED WITH OTHER GALAXIES AND ALSO THAT THERE WERE MANY MORE WEAK SOURCES THAN STRONG ONES THEY INTERPRETED THE WEAK SOURCES AS BEING THE MORE DISTANT ONES AND THE STRONGER ONES AS BEING NEARER THEN THERE APPEARED TO BE LESS COMMON SOURCES PER UNIT VOLUME OF SPACE FOR THE NEARBY SOURCES THAN FOR THE DISTANT ONES THIS COULD MEAN THAT WE ARE AT THE CENTER OF A GREAT REGION IN THE UNIVERSE IN WHICH THE SOURCES ARE FEWER THAN ELSEWHERE ALTERNATIVELY IT COULD MEAN THAT THE SOURCES WERE MORE NUMEROUS IN THE PAST AT THE TIME THAT THE RADIO WAVES LEFT ON THEIR JOURNEY TO US THAN THEY ARE NOW EITHER EXPLANATION CONTRADICTED THE PREDICTIONS OF THE STEADY STATE THEORY MOREOVER THE DISCOVERY OF THE MICROWAVE RADIATION BY PENZIAS AND WILSON IN ALSO INDICATED THAT THE UNIVERSE MUST HAVE BEEN MUCH DENSER IN THE PAST THE STEADY STATE THEORY THEREFORE HAD TO BE ABANDONED ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO AVOID THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A BIG BANG AND THEREFORE A BEGINNING OF TIME WAS MADE BY TWO RUSSIAN SCIENTISTS EVGENII LIFSHITZ AND ISAAC KHALATNIKOV IN THEY SUGGESTED THAT THE BIG BANG MIGHT BE A PECULIARITY OF FRIEDMANNS MODELS ALONE WHICH AFTER ALL WERE ONLY APPROXIMATIONS TO THE REAL UNIVERSE PERHAPS OF ALL THE MODELS THAT WERE ROUGHLY LIKE THE REAL UNIVERSE ONLY FRIEDMANNS WOULD CONTAIN A BIG BANG SINGULARITY IN FRIEDMANNS MODELS THE GALAXIES ARE ALL MOVING DIRECTLY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER SO IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT AT SOME TIME IN THE PAST THEY WERE ALL AT THE SAME PLACE IN THE REAL UNIVERSE HOWEVER THE GALAXIES ARE NOT JUST MOVING DIRECTLY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER THEY ALSO HAVE SMALL SIDEWAYS VELOCITIES SO IN REALITY THEY NEED NEVER HAVE BEEN ALL AT EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE ONLY VERY CLOSE TOGETHER PERHAPS THEN THE CURRENT EXPANDING UNIVERSE RESULTED NOT FROM A BIG BANG SINGULARITY BUT FROM AN EARLIER CONTRACTING PHASE AS THE UNIVERSE HAD COLLAPSED THE PARTICLES IN IT MIGHT NOT HAVE ALL COLLIDED BUT HAD FLOWN PAST AND THEN AWAY FROM EACH OTHER PRODUCING THE PRESENT EXPANSION OF THE THE UNIVERSE THAT WERE ROUGHLY LIKE FRIEDMANNS MODELS BUT TOOK ACCOUNT OF THE IRREGULARITIES AND RANDOM VELOCITIES OF GALAXIES IN THE REAL UNIVERSE THEY SHOWED THAT SUCH MODELS COULD START WITH A BIG BANG EVEN THOUGH THE GALAXIES WERE NO LONGER ALWAYS MOVING DIRECTLY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER BUT THEY CLAIMED THAT THIS WAS STILL ONLY POSSIBLE IN CERTAIN EXCEPTIONAL MODELS IN WHICH THE GALAXIES WERE ALL MOVING IN JUST THE RIGHT WAY THEY ARGUED THAT SINCE THERE SEEMED TO BE INFINITELY MORE FRIEDMANNLIKE MODELS WITHOUT A BIG BANG SINGULARITY THAN THERE WERE WITH ONE WE SHOULD CONCLUDE THAT THERE HAD NOT IN REALITY BEEN A BIG BANG THEY LATER REALIZED HOWEVER THAT THERE WAS A MUCH MORE GENERAL CLASS OF FRIEDMANNLIKE MODELS THAT DID HAVE SINGULARITIES AND IN WHICH THE GALAXIES DID NOT HAVE TO BE MOVING ANY SPECIAL WAY THEY THEREFORE WITHDREW THEIR CLAIM IN  THE WORK OF LIFSHITZ AND KHALATNIKOV WAS VALUABLE BECAUSE IT SHOWED THAT THE UNIVERSE COULD HAVE HAD A SINGULARITY A BIG BANG IF THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY WAS CORRECT HOWEVER IT DID NOT RESOLVE THE CRUCIAL QUESTION DOES GENERAL RELATIVITY PREDICT THAT OUR UNIVERSE SHOULD HAVE HAD A BIG BANG A BEGINNING OF TIME THE ANSWER TO THIS CARNE OUT OF A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT APPROACH INTRODUCED BY A BRITISH MATHEMATICIAN AND PHYSICIST ROGER PENROSE IN USING THE WAY LIGHT CONES BEHAVE IN GENERAL RELATIVITY TOGETHER WITH THE FACT THAT GRAVITY IS ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE HE SHOWED THAT A STAR COLLAPSING UNDER ITS OWN GRAVITY IS TRAPPED IN A REGION WHOSE SURFACE EVENTUALLY SHRINKS TO ZERO SIZE AND SINCE THE SURFACE OF THE REGION SHRINKS TO ZERO SO TOO MUST ITS VOLUME ALL THE MATTER IN THE STAR WILL BE COMPRESSED INTO A REGION OF ZERO VOLUME SO THE DENSITY OF MATTER AND THE CURVATURE OF SPACETIME BECOME INFINITE IN OTHER WORDS ONE HAS A SINGULARITY CONTAINED WITHIN A REGION OF SPACETIME KNOWN AS A BLACK HOLE AT FIRST SIGHT PENROSES RESULT APPLIED ONLY TO STARS IT DIDNT HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE HAD A BIG BANG SINGULARITY IN ITS PAST HOWEVER AT THE TIME THAT PENROSE PRODUCED HIS THEOREM I WAS A RESEARCH STUDENT DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM WITH WHICH TO COMPLETE MY PHD THESIS TWO YEARS BEFORE I HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED AS SUFFERING FROM ALS COMMONLY KNOWN AS LOU GEHRIGS DISEASE OR MOTOR NEURON DISEASE AND GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT I HAD ONLY ONE OR TWO MORE YEARS TO LIVE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE HAD NOT SEEMED MUCH POINT IN WORKING ON MY PHD I DID NOT EXPECT TO SURVIVE THAT LONG YET TWO YEARS HAD GONE BY AND I WAS NOT THAT MUCH WORSE IN FACT THINGS WERE GOING RATHER WELL FOR ME AND I HAD GOTTEN ENGAGED TO A VERY NICE GIRL JANE WILDE BUT IN ORDER TO GET MARRIED I NEEDED A JOB AND IN ORDER TO GET A JOB I NEEDED A PHD IN I READ ABOUT PENROSES THEOREM THAT ANY BODY UNDERGOING GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE MUST EVENTUALLY FORM A SINGULARITY I SOON REALIZED THAT IF ONE REVERSED THE DIRECTION OF TIME IN PENROSES THEOREM SO THAT THE COLLAPSE BECAME AN EXPANSION THE CONDITIONS OF HIS THEOREM WOULD STILL HOLD PROVIDED THE UNIVERSE WERE ROUGHLY LIKE A FRIEDMANN MODEL ON LARGE SCALES AT THE PRESENT TIME PENROSES THEOREM HAD SHOWN THAT ANY COLLAPSING STAR MUST END IN A SINGULARITY THE TIMEREVERSED ARGUMENT SHOWED THAT ANY FRIEDMANNLIKE EXPANDING UNIVERSE MUST HAVE BEGUN WITH A SINGULARITY FOR TECHNICAL REASONS PENROSES THEOREM REQUIRED THAT THE UNIVERSE BE INFINITE IN SPACE SO I COULD IN FACT USE IT TO PROVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A SINGULARITY ONLY IF THE UNIVERSE WAS EXPANDING FAST ENOUGH TO AVOID COLLAPSING AGAIN SINCE ONLY THOSE FRIEDMANN MODELS WERE INFINITE IN SPACE DURING THE NEXT FEW YEARS I DEVELOPED NEW MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES TO REMOVE THIS AND OTHER TECHNICAL CONDITIONS FROM THE THEOREMS THAT PROVED THAT SINGULARITIES MUST OCCUR THE FINAL RESULT WAS A JOINT PAPER BY PENROSE AND MYSELF IN WHICH AT LAST PROVED THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A BIG BANG SINGULARITY PROVIDED ONLY THAT GENERAL RELATIVITY IS CORRECT AND THE UNIVERSE CONTAINS AS MUCH MATTER AS WE OBSERVE THERE WAS A LOT OF OPPOSITION TO OUR WORK PARTLY FROM THE RUSSIANS BECAUSE OF THEIR MARXIST BELIEF IN SCIENTIFIC DETERMINISM AND PARTLY FROM PEOPLE WHO FELT THAT THE WHOLE IDEA OF SINGULARITIES WAS REPUGNANT AND SPOILED THE BEAUTY OF EINSTEINS THEORY HOWEVER ONE CANNOT REALLY ARGUE WITH A MATHEMATICAL THEOREM SO IN THE END OUR WORK BECAME GENERALLY ACCEPTED AND NOWADAYS NEARLY EVERYONE ASSUMES THAT THE UNIVERSE STARTED WITH A BIG BANG SINGULARITY IT IS PERHAPS IRONIC THAT HAVING CHANGED MY MIND I AM NOW TRYING TO CONVINCE OTHER PHYSICISTS THAT THERE WAS IN FACT NO SINGULARITY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE AS WE SHALL SEE LATER IT CAN DISAPPEAR ONCE QUANTUM EFFECTS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS CHAPTER HOW IN LESS THAN HALF A CENTURY MANS VIEW OF THE UNIVERSE FORMED OVER MILLENNIA HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED HUBBLES DISCOVERY THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS EXPANDING AND THE REALIZATION OF THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF OUR OWN PLANET IN THE VASTNESS OF THE UNIVERSE WERE JUST THE STARTING POINT AS EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL EVIDENCE MOUNTED IT BECAME MORE AND MORE CLEAR THAT THE UNIVERSE MUST HAVE HAD A BEGINNING IN TIME UNTIL IN THIS WAS FINALLY PROVED BY PENROSE AND MYSELF ON THE BASIS OF EINSTEINS GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY THAT PROOF SHOWED THAT GENERAL RELATIVITY IS ONLY AN INCOMPLETE THEORY IT CANNOT TELL US HOW THE UNIVERSE STARTED OFF BECAUSE IT PREDICTS THAT ALL PHYSICAL THEORIES INCLUDING ITSELF BREAK DOWN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE HOWEVER GENERAL RELATIVITY CLAIMS TO BE ONLY A PARTIAL THEORY SO WHAT THE SINGULARITY THEOREMS REALLY SHOW IS THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A TIME IN THE VERY EARLY UNIVERSE WHEN THE UNIVERSE WAS SO SMALL THAT ONE COULD NO LONGER IGNORE THE SMALLSCALE EFFECTS OF THE OTHER GREAT PARTIAL THEORY OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY QUANTUM MECHANICS AT THE START OF THE S THEN WE WERE FORCED TO TURN OUR SEARCH FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSE FROM OUR THEORY OF THE EXTRAORDINARILY VAST TO OUR THEORY OF THE EXTRAORDINARILY TINY THAT THEORY QUANTUM MECHANICS WILL BE DESCRIBED NEXT BEFORE WE TURN TO THE EFFORTS TO COMBINE THE TWO PARTIAL THEORIES INTO A SINGLE QUANTUM THEORY OF GRAVITY THE SUCCESS OF SCIENTIFIC THEORIES PARTICULARLY NEWTONS THEORY OF GRAVITY LED THE FRENCH SCIENTIST THE MARQUIS DE LAPLACE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY TO ARGUE THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS COMPLETELY DETERMINISTIC LAPLACE SUGGESTED THAT THERE SHOULD BE A SET OF SCIENTIFIC LAWS THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO PREDICT EVERYTHING THAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE UNIVERSE IF ONLY WE KNEW THE COMPLETE STATE OF THE UNIVERSE AT ONE TIME FOR EXAMPLE IF WE KNEW THE POSITIONS AND SPEEDS OF THE SUN AND THE PLANETS AT ONE TIME THEN WE COULD USE NEWTONS LAWS TO CALCULATE THE STATE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AT ANY OTHER TIME DETERMINISM SEEMS FAIRLY OBVIOUS IN THIS CASE BUT LAPLACE WENT FURTHER TO ASSUME THAT THERE WERE SIMILAR LAWS GOVERNING EVERYTHING ELSE INCLUDING HUMAN BEHAVIOR THE DOCTRINE OF SCIENTIFIC DETERMINISM WAS STRONGLY RESISTED BY MANY PEOPLE WHO FELT THAT IT INFRINGED GODS FREEDOM TO INTERVENE IN THE WORLD BUT IT REMAINED THE STANDARD ASSUMPTION OF SCIENCE UNTIL THE EARLY YEARS OF THIS CENTURY ONE OF THE FIRST INDICATIONS THAT THIS BELIEF WOULD HAVE TO BE ABANDONED CAME WHEN CALCULATIONS BY THE BRITISH SCIENTISTS LORD RAYLEIGH AND SIR JAMES JEANS SUGGESTED THAT A HOT OBJECT OR BODY SUCH AS A STAR MUST RADIATE ENERGY AT AN INFINITE RATE ACCORDING TO THE LAWS WE BELIEVED AT THE TIME A HOT BODY OUGHT TO GIVE OFF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES SUCH AS RADIO WAVES VISIBLE LIGHT OR X RAYS EQUALLY AT ALL FREQUENCIES FOR EXAMPLE A HOT BODY SHOULD RADIATE THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY IN WAVES WITH FREQUENCIES BETWEEN ONE AND TWO MILLION MILLION WAVES A SECOND AS IN WAVES WITH FREQUENCIES BETWEEN TWO AND THREE MILLION MILLION WAVES A SECOND NOW SINCE THE NUMBER OF WAVES A SECOND IS UNLIMITED THIS WOULD MEAN THAT THE TOTAL ENERGY RADIATED WOULD BE INFINITE IN ORDER TO AVOID THIS OBVIOUSLY RIDICULOUS RESULT THE GERMAN SCIENTIST MAX PLANCK SUGGESTED IN THAT LIGHT X RAYS AND OTHER WAVES COULD NOT BE EMITTED AT AN ARBITRARY RATE BUT ONLY IN CERTAIN PACKETS THAT HE CALLED QUANTA MOREOVER EACH QUANTUM HAD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT WAS GREATER THE HIGHER THE FREQUENCY OF THE WAVES SO AT A HIGH ENOUGH FREQUENCY THE EMISSION OF A SINGLE QUANTUM WOULD REQUIRE MORE ENERGY THAN WAS AVAILABLE THUS THE RADIATION AT HIGH FREQUENCIES WOULD BE REDUCED AND SO THE RATE AT WHICH THE BODY LOST ENERGY WOULD BE FINITE THE QUANTUM HYPOTHESIS EXPLAINED THE OBSERVED RATE OF EMISSION OF RADIATION FROM HOT BODIES VERY WELL BUT ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR DETERMINISM WERE NOT REALIZED UNTIL WHEN ANOTHER GERMAN SCIENTIST WERNER HEISENBERG FORMULATED HIS FAMOUS UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IN ORDER TO PREDICT THE FUTURE POSITION AND VELOCITY OF A PARTICLE ONE HAS TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE ITS PRESENT POSITION AND VELOCITY ACCURATELY THE OBVIOUS WAY TO DO THIS IS TO SHINE LIGHT ON THE PARTICLE SOME OF THE WAVES OF LIGHT WILL BE SCATTERED BY THE PARTICLE AND THIS WILL INDICATE ITS POSITION HOWEVER ONE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE PARTICLE MORE ACCURATELY THAN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE WAVE CRESTS OF LIGHT SO ONE NEEDS TO USE LIGHT OF A SHORT WAVELENGTH IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE POSITION OF THE PARTICLE PRECISELY NOW BY PLANCKS QUANTUM HYPOTHESIS ONE CANNOT USE AN ARBITRARILY SMALL AMOUNT OF LIGHT ONE HAS TO USE AT LEAST ONE QUANTUM THIS QUANTUM WILL DISTURB THE PARTICLE AND CHANGE ITS VELOCITY IN A WAY THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED MOREOVER THE MORE ACCURATELY ONE MEASURES THE POSITION THE SHORTER THE WAVELENGTH OF THE LIGHT THAT ONE NEEDS AND HENCE THE HIGHER THE ENERGY OF A SINGLE QUANTUM SO THE VELOCITY OF THE PARTICLE WILL BE DISTURBED BY A LARGER AMOUNT IN OTHER WORDS THE MORE ACCURATELY YOU TRY TO MEASURE THE POSITION OF THE PARTICLE THE LESS ACCURATELY YOU CAN MEASURE ITS SPEED AND VICE VERSA HEISENBERG SHOWED THAT THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE POSITION OF THE PARTICLE TIMES THE UNCERTAINTY IN ITS VELOCITY TIMES THE MASS OF THE PARTICLE CAN NEVER BE SMALLER THAN A CERTAIN QUANTITY WHICH IS KNOWN AS PLANCKS CONSTANT MOREOVER THIS LIMIT DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE WAY IN WHICH ONE TRIES TO MEASURE THE POSITION OR VELOCITY OF THE PARTICLE OR ON THE TYPE OF PARTICLE HEISENBERGS UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IS A FUNDAMENTAL INESCAPABLE PROPERTY OF THE WORLD THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE HAD PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WAY IN WHICH WE VIEW THE WORLD EVEN AFTER MORE THAN SEVENTY YEARS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY APPRECIATED BY MANY PHILOSOPHERS AND ARE STILL THE SUBJECT OF MUCH CONTROVERSY THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE SIGNALED AN END TO LAPLACES DREAM OF A THEORY OF SCIENCE A MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY DETERMINISTIC ONE CERTAINLY CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE EVENTS EXACTLY IF ONE CANNOT EVEN MEASURE THE PRESENT STATE OF THE UNIVERSE PRECISELY WE COULD STILL IMAGINE THAT THERE IS A SET OF LAWS THAT DETERMINE EVENTS COMPLETELY FOR SOME SUPERNATURAL BEING WHO COULD OBSERVE THE PRESENT STATE OF THE UNIVERSE WITHOUT DISTURBING IT HOWEVER SUCH MODELS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE NOT OF MUCH INTEREST TO US ORDINARY MORTALS IT SEEMS BETTER TO EMPLOY THE PRINCIPLE OF ECONOMY KNOWN AS OCCAMS RAZOR AND CUT OUT ALL THE FEATURES OF THE THEORY THAT CANNOT BE OBSERVED THIS APPROACH LED HEISENBERG ERWIN SCHRODINGER AND PAUL DIRAC IN THE S TO REFORMULATE MECHANICS INTO A NEW THEORY CALLED QUANTUM MECHANICS BASED ON THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IN THIS THEORY PARTICLES NO LONGER HAD SEPARATE WELLDEFINED POSITIONS AND VELOCITIES THAT COULD NOT BE OBSERVED INSTEAD THEY HAD A QUANTUM STATE WHICH WAS A COMBINATION OF POSITION AND VELOCITY IN GENERAL QUANTUM MECHANICS DOES NOT PREDICT A SINGLE DEFINITE RESULT FOR AN OBSERVATION INSTEAD IT PREDICTS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT POSSIBLE OUTCOMES AND TELLS US HOW LIKELY EACH OF THESE IS THAT IS TO SAY IF ONE MADE THE SAME MEASUREMENT ON A LARGE NUMBER OF SIMILAR SYSTEMS EACH OF WHICH STARTED OFF IN THE SAME WAY ONE WOULD FIND THAT THE RESULT OF THE MEASUREMENT WOULD BE A IN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CASES B IN A DIFFERENT NUMBER AND SO ON ONE COULD PREDICT THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT THE RESULT WOULD BE A OR B BUT ONE COULD NOT PREDICT THE SPECIFIC RESULT OF AN INDIVIDUAL MEASUREMENT QUANTUM MECHANICS THEREFORE INTRODUCES AN UNAVOIDABLE ELEMENT OF UNPREDICTABILITY OR RANDOMNESS INTO SCIENCE EINSTEIN OBJECTED TO THIS VERY STRONGLY DESPITE THE IMPORTANT ROLE HE HAD PLAYED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE IDEAS EINSTEIN WAS AWARDED THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR HIS CONTRIBUTION TO QUANTUM THEORY NEVERTHELESS EINSTEIN NEVER ACCEPTED THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS GOVERNED BY CHANCE HIS FEELINGS WERE SUMMED UP IN HIS FAMOUS STATEMENT GOD DOES NOT PLAY DICE MOST OTHER SCIENTISTS HOWEVER WERE WILLING TO ACCEPT QUANTUM MECHANICS BECAUSE IT AGREED PERFECTLY WITH EXPERIMENT INDEED IT HAS BEEN AN OUTSTANDINGLY SUCCESSFUL THEORY AND UNDERLIES NEARLY ALL OF MODERN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IT GOVERNS THE BEHAVIOR OF TRANSISTORS AND INTEGRATED CIRCUITS WHICH ARE THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES SUCH AS TELEVISIONS AND COMPUTERS AND IS ALSO THE BASIS OF MODERN CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY THE ONLY AREAS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE INTO WHICH QUANTUM MECHANICS HAS NOT YET BEEN PROPERLY INCORPORATED ARE GRAVITY AND THE LARGESCALE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE ALTHOUGH LIGHT IS MADE UP OF WAVES PLANCKS QUANTUM HYPOTHESIS TELLS US THAT IN SOME WAYS IT BEHAVES AS IF IT WERE COMPOSED OF PARTICLES IT CAN BE EMITTED OR ABSORBED ONLY IN PACKETS OR QUANTA EQUALLY HEISENBERGS UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IMPLIES THAT PARTICLES BEHAVE IN SOME RESPECTS LIKE WAVES THEY DO NOT HAVE A DEFINITE POSITION BUT ARE SMEARED OUT WITH A CERTAIN PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION THE THEORY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IS BASED ON AN ENTIRELY NEW TYPE OF MATHEMATICS THAT NO LONGER DESCRIBES THE REAL WORLD IN TERMS OF PARTICLES AND WAVES IT IS ONLY THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE WORLD THAT MAY BE DESCRIBED IN THOSE TERMS THERE IS THUS A DUALITY BETWEEN WAVES AND PARTICLES IN QUANTUM MECHANICS FOR SOME PURPOSES IT IS HELPFUL TO THINK OF PARTICLES AS WAVES AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES IT IS BETTER TO THINK OF WAVES AS PARTICLES AN IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCE OF THIS IS THAT ONE CAN OBSERVE WHAT IS CALLED INTERFERENCE BETWEEN TWO SETS OF WAVES OR PARTICLES THAT IS TO SAY THE CRESTS OF ONE SET OF WAVES MAY COINCIDE WITH THE TROUGHS OF THE OTHER SET THE TWO SETS OF WAVES THEN CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT RATHER THAN ADDING UP TO A STRONGER WAVE AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT A FAMILIAR EXAMPLE OF INTERFERENCE IN THE CASE OF LIGHT IS THE COLORS THAT ARE OFTEN SEEN IN SOAP BUBBLES THESE ARE CAUSED BY REFLECTION OF LIGHT FROM THE TWO SIDES OF THE THIN FILM OF WATER FORMING THE BUBBLE WHITE LIGHT CONSISTS OF LIGHT WAVES OF ALL DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS OR COLORS FOR CERTAIN WAVELENGTHS THE CRESTS OF THE WAVES REFLECTED FROM ONE SIDE OF THE SOAP FILM COINCIDE WITH THE TROUGHS REFLECTED FROM THE OTHER SIDE THE COLORS CORRESPONDING TO THESE WAVELENGTHS ARE ABSENT FROM THE REFLECTED LIGHT WHICH THEREFORE APPEARS TO BE COLORED INTERFERENCE CAN ALSO OCCUR FOR PARTICLES BECAUSE OF THE DUALITY INTRODUCED BY QUANTUM MECHANICS A FAMOUS EXAMPLE IS THE SOCALLED TWOSLIT EXPERIMENT PARTICULAR COLOR THAT IS OF A PARTICULAR WAVELENGTH MOST OF THE LIGHT WILL HIT THE PARTITION BUT A SMALL AMOUNT WILL GO THROUGH THE SLITS NOW SUPPOSE ONE PLACES A SCREEN ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE PARTITION FROM THE LIGHT ANY POINT ON THE SCREEN WILL RECEIVE WAVES FROM THE TWO SLITS HOWEVER IN GENERAL THE DISTANCE THE LIGHT HAS TO TRAVEL FROM THE SOURCE TO THE SCREEN VIA THE TWO SLITS WILL BE DIFFERENT THIS WILL MEAN THAT THE WAVES FROM THE SLITS WILL NOT BE IN PHASE WITH EACH OTHER WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT THE SCREEN IN SOME PLACES THE WAVES WILL CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT AND IN OTHERS THEY WILL REINFORCE EACH OTHER THE RESULT IS A CHARACTERISTIC PATTERN OF LIGHT AND DARK FRINGES THE REMARKABLE THING IS THAT ONE GETS EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF FRINGES IF ONE REPLACES THE SOURCE OF LIGHT BY A SOURCE OF PARTICLES SUCH AS ELECTRONS WITH A DEFINITE SPEED THIS MEANS THAT THE CORRESPONDING WAVES HAVE A DEFINITE LENGTH IT SEEMS THE MORE PECULIAR BECAUSE IF ONE ONLY HAS ONE SLIT ONE DOES NOT GET ANY FRINGES JUST A UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRONS ACROSS THE SCREEN ONE MIGHT THEREFORE THINK THAT OPENING ANOTHER SLIT WOULD JUST INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ELECTRONS HITTING EACH POINT OF THE SCREEN BUT BECAUSE OF INTERFERENCE IT ACTUALLY DECREASES IT IN SOME PLACES IF ELECTRONS ARE SENT THROUGH THE SLITS ONE AT A TIME ONE WOULD EXPECT EACH TO PASS THROUGH ONE SLIT OR THE OTHER AND SO BEHAVE JUST AS IF THE SLIT IT PASSED THROUGH WERE THE ONLY ONE THERE GIVING A UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION ON THE SCREEN IN REALITY HOWEVER EVEN WHEN THE ELECTRONS ARE SENT ONE AT A TIME THE FRINGES STILL APPEAR EACH ELECTRON THEREFORE MUST BE THE PHENOMENON OF INTERFERENCE BETWEEN PARTICLES HAS BEEN CRUCIAL TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRUCTURE OF ATOMS THE BASIC UNITS OF CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY AND THE BUILDING BLOCKS OUT OF WHICH WE AND EVERYTHING AROUND US ARE MADE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY IT WAS THOUGHT THAT ATOMS WERE RATHER LIKE THE PLANETS ORBITING THE SUN WITH ELECTRONS PARTICLES OF NEGATIVE ELECTRICITY ORBITING AROUND A CENTRAL NUCLEUS WHICH CARRIED POSITIVE ELECTRICITY THE ATTRACTION BETWEEN THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ELECTRICITY WAS SUPPOSED TO KEEP THE ELECTRONS IN THEIR ORBITS IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN THE SUN AND THE PLANETS KEEPS THE PLANETS IN THEIR ORBITS THE TROUBLE WITH THIS WAS THAT THE LAWS OF MECHANICS AND ELECTRICITY BEFORE QUANTUM MECHANICS PREDICTED THAT THE ELECTRONS WOULD LOSE ENERGY AND SO SPIRAL INWARD UNTIL THEY COLLIDED WITH THE NUCLEUS THIS WOULD MEAN THAT THE ATOM AND INDEED ALL MATTER SHOULD RAPIDLY COLLAPSE TO A STATE OF VERY HIGH DENSITY A PARTIAL SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WAS FOUND BY THE DANISH SCIENTIST NIELS BOHR IN HE SUGGESTED THAT MAYBE THE ELECTRONS WERE NOT ABLE TO ORBIT AT JUST ANY DISTANCE FROM THE CENTRAL NUCLEUS BUT ONLY AT CERTAIN SPECIFIED DISTANCES IF ONE ALSO SUPPOSED THAT ONLY ONE OR TWO ELECTRONS COULD ORBIT AT ANY ONE OF THESE DISTANCES THIS WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE ATOM BECAUSE THE ELECTRONS COULD NOT SPIRAL IN ANY FARTHER THAN TO FILL UP THE ORBITS WITH E LEAST DISTANCES AND ENERGIES THIS MODEL EXPLAINED QUITE WELL THE STRUCTURE OF THE SIMPLEST ATOM HYDROGEN WHICH HAS ONLY ONE ELECTRON ORBITING AROUND THE NUCLEUS BUT IT WAS NOT CLEAR HOW ONE OUGHT TO EXTEND IT TO MORE COMPLICATED ATOMS MOREOVER THE IDEA OF A LIMITED SET OF ALLOWED ORBITS SEEMED VERY ARBITRARY THE NEW THEORY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS RESOLVED THIS DIFFICULTY IT REVEALED THAT AN ELECTRON ORBITING AROUND THE NUCLEUS COULD BE THOUGHT OF AS A WAVE WITH A WAVELENGTH THAT DEPENDED ON ITS VELOCITY FOR CERTAIN ORBITS THE LENGTH OF THE ORBIT WOULD CORRESPOND TO A WHOLE NUMBER AS OPPOSED TO A FRACTIONAL NUMBER OF WAVELENGTHS OF THE ELECTRON FOR THESE ORBITS THE WAVE CREST WOULD BE IN THE SAME POSITION EACH TIME ROUND SO THE WAVES WOULD ADD UP THESE ORBITS WOULD CORRESPOND TO BOHRS ALLOWED ORBITS HOWEVER FOR ORBITS WHOSE LENGTHS WERE NOT A WHOLE NUMBER OF WAVELENGTHS EACH WAVE CREST WOULD EVENTUALLY BE CANCELED OUT BY A TROUGH AS THE ELECTRONS WENT ROUND THESE ORBITS WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED A NICE WAY OF VISUALIZING THE WAVEPARTICLE DUALITY IS THE SOCALLED SUM OVER HISTORIES INTRODUCED BY THE AMERICAN SCIENTIST RICHARD FEYNMAN IN THIS APPROACH THE PARTICLE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE A SINGLE HISTORY OR PATH IN SPACETIME AS IT WOULD IN A CLASSICAL NONQUANTUM THEORY INSTEAD IT IS SUPPOSED TO GO FROM A TO B BY EVERY POSSIBLE PATH WITH EACH PATH THERE ARE ASSOCIATED A COUPLE OF NUMBERS ONE REPRESENTS THE SIZE OF A WAVE AND THE OTHER REPRESENTS THE POSITION IN THE CYCLE IE WHETHER IT IS AT A CREST OR A TROUGH THE PROBABILITY OF GOING FROM A TO B IS FOUND BY ADDING UP THE WAVES FOR ALL THE PATHS IN GENERAL IF ONE COMPARES A SET OF NEIGHBORING PATHS THE PHASES OR POSITIONS IN THE CYCLE WILL DIFFER GREATLY THIS MEANS THAT THE WAVES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PATHS WILL ALMOST EXACTLY CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT HOWEVER FOR SOME SETS OF NEIGHBORING PATHS THE PHASE WILL NOT VARY MUCH BETWEEN PATHS THE WAVES FOR THESE PATHS WILL NOT CANCEL OUT SUCH PATHS CORRESPOND TO BOHRS ALLOWED ORBITS WITH THESE IDEAS IN CONCRETE MATHEMATICAL FORM IT WAS RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO CALCULATE THE ALLOWED ORBITS IN MORE COMPLICATED ATOMS AND EVEN IN MOLECULES WHICH ARE MADE UP OF A NUMBER OF ATOMS HELD TOGETHER BY ELECTRONS IN ORBITS THAT GO ROUND MORE THAN ONE NUCLEUS SINCE THE STRUCTURE OF MOLECULES AND THEIR REACTIONS WITH EACH OTHER UNDERLIE ALL OF CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY QUANTUM MECHANICS ALLOWS US IN PRINCIPLE TO PREDICT NEARLY EVERYTHING WE SEE AROUND US WITHIN THE LIMITS SET BY THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IN PRACTICE HOWEVER THE CALCULATIONS REQUIRED FOR SYSTEMS CONTAINING MORE THAN A FEW ELECTRONS ARE SO COMPLICATED THAT WE CANNOT DO THEM EINSTEINS GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY SEEMS TO GOVERN THE LARGESCALE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE IT IS WHAT IS CALLED A CLASSICAL THEORY THAT IS IT DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AS IT SHOULD FOR CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER THEORIES THE REASON THAT THIS DOES NOT LEAD TO ANY DISCREPANCY WITH OBSERVATION IS THAT ALL THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELDS THAT WE NORMALLY EXPERIENCE ARE VERY WEAK HOWEVER THE SINGULARITY THEOREMS DISCUSSED EARLIER INDICATE THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD SHOULD GET VERY STRONG IN AT LEAST TWO SITUATIONS BLACK HOLES AND THE BIG BANG IN SUCH STRONG FIELDS THE EFFECTS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS SHOULD BE IMPORTANT THUS IN A SENSE CLASSICAL GENERAL RELATIVITY BY PREDICTING POINTS OF INFINITE DENSITY PREDICTS ITS OWN DOWNFALL JUST AS CLASSICAL THAT IS NONQUANTUM MECHANICS PREDICTED ITS DOWNFALL BY SUGGESTING THAT ATOMS SHOULD COLLAPSE TO INFINITE DENSITY WE DO NOT YET HAVE A COMPLETE CONSISTENT THEORY THAT UNIFIES GENERAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS BUT WE DO KNOW A NUMBER OF THE FEATURES IT SHOULD HAVE THE CONSEQUENCES THAT THESE WOULD HAVE FOR BLACK HOLES AND THE BIG BANG WILL BE DESCRIBED IN LATER CHAPTERS FOR THE MOMENT HOWEVER WE SHALL TURN TO THE RECENT ATTEMPTS TO BRING TOGETHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE OTHER FORCES OF NATURE ARISTOTLE BELIEVED THAT ALL THE MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE WAS MADE UP OF FOUR BASIC ELEMENTS EARTH AIR FIRE AND WATER THESE ELEMENTS WERE ACTED ON BY TWO FORCES GRAVITY THE TENDENCY FOR EARTH AND WATER TO SINK AND LEVITY THE TENDENCY FOR AIR AND FIRE TO RISE THIS DIVISION OF THE CONTENTS OF THE UNIVERSE INTO MATTER AND FORCES IS STILL USED TODAY ARISTOTLE BELIEVED THAT MATTER WAS CONTINUOUS THAT IS ONE COULD DIVIDE A PIECE OF MATTER INTO SMALLER AND SMALLER BITS WITHOUT ANY LIMIT ONE NEVER CAME UP AGAINST A GRAIN OF MATTER THAT COULD NOT BE DIVIDED FURTHER A FEW GREEKS HOWEVER SUCH AS DEMOCRITUS HELD THAT MATTER WAS INHERENTLY GRAINY AND THAT EVERYTHING WAS MADE UP OF LARGE NUMBERS OF VARIOUS DIFFERENT KINDS OF ATOMS THE WORD ATOM MEANS INDIVISIBLE IN GREEK FOR CENTURIES THE ARGUMENT CONTINUED WITHOUT ANY REAL EVIDENCE ON EITHER SIDE BUT IN THE BRITISH CHEMIST AND PHYSICIST JOHN DALTON POINTED OUT THAT THE FACT THAT CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS ALWAYS COMBINED IN CERTAIN PROPORTIONS COULD BE EXPLAINED BY THE GROUPING TOGETHER OF ATOMS TO FORM UNITS CALLED MOLECULES HOWEVER THE ARGUMENT BETWEEN THE TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT WAS NOT FINALLY SETTLED IN FAVOR OF THE ATOMISTS UNTIL THE EARLY YEARS OF THIS CENTURY ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PIECES OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WAS PROVIDED BY EINSTEIN IN A PAPER WRITTEN IN A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE FAMOUS PAPER ON SPECIAL RELATIVITY EINSTEIN POINTED OUT THAT WHAT WAS CALLED BROWNIAN MOTION THE IRREGULAR RANDOM MOTION OF SMALL PARTICLES OF DUST SUSPENDED IN A LIQUID COULD BE EXPLAINED AS THE EFFECT OF ATOMS OF THE LIQUID COLLIDING WITH THE DUST PARTICLES BY THIS TIME THERE WERE ALREADY SUSPICIONS THAT THESE ATOMS WERE NOT AFTER ALL INDIVISIBLE SEVERAL YEARS PREVIOUSLY A FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE J J THOMSON HAD DEMONSTRATED THE EXISTENCE OF A PARTICLE OF MATTER CALLED THE ELECTRON THAT HAD A MASS LESS THAN ONE THOUSANDTH OF THAT OF THE LIGHTEST ATOM HE USED A SETUP RATHER LIKE A MODERN TV PICTURE TUBE A REDHOT METAL FILAMENT GAVE OFF THE ELECTRONS AND BECAUSE THESE HAVE A NEGATIVE ELECTRIC CHARGE AN ELECTRIC FIELD COULD BE USED TO ACCELERATE THEM TOWARD A PHOSPHORCOATED SCREEN WHEN THEY HIT THE SCREEN FLASHES OF LIGHT WERE GENERATED SOON IT WAS REALIZED THAT THESE ELECTRONS MUST BE COMING FROM WITHIN THE ATOMS THEMSELVES AND IN  THE NEW ZEALAND PHYSICIST ERNEST RUTHERFORD FINALLY SHOWED THAT THE ATOMS OF MATTER DO HAVE INTERNAL STRUCTURE THEY ARE MADE UP OF AN EXTREMELY TINY POSITIVELY CHARGED NUCLEUS AROUND WHICH A NUMBER OF ELECTRONS ORBIT HE DEDUCED THIS BY ANALYZING THE WAY IN WHICH ALPHAPARTICLES WHICH ARE POSITIVELY CHARGED PARTICLES GIVEN OFF BY RADIOACTIVE ATOMS ARE DEFLECTED WHEN THEY COLLIDE WITH ATOMS AT FIRST IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE NUCLEUS OF THE ATOM WAS MADE UP OF ELECTRONS AND DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF A POSITIVELY CHARGED PARTICLE CALLED THE PROTON FROM THE GREEK WORD MEANING FIRST BECAUSE IT WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT FROM WHICH MATTER WAS MADE HOWEVER IN A COLLEAGUE OF RUTHERFORDS AT CAMBRIDGE JAMES CHADWICK DISCOVERED THAT THE NUCLEUS CONTAINED ANOTHER PARTICLE CALLED THE NEUTRON WHICH HAD ALMOST THE SAME MASS AS A PROTON BUT NO ELECTRICAL CHARGE CHADWICK RECEIVED THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR HIS DISCOVERY AND WAS ELECTED MASTER OF GONVILLE AND CAIUS COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE THE COLLEGE OF WHICH I AM NOW A FELLOW HE LATER RESIGNED AS MASTER BECAUSE OF DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE FELLOWS THERE HAD BEEN A BITTER DISPUTE IN THE COLLEGE EVER SINCE A GROUP OF YOUNG FELLOWS RETURNING AFTER THE WAR HAD VOTED MANY OF THE OLD FELLOWS OUT OF THE COLLEGE OFFICES THEY HAD HELD FOR A LONG TIME THIS WAS BEFORE MY TIME I JOINED THE COLLEGE IN AT THE TAIL END OF THE BITTERNESS WHEN SIMILAR DISAGREEMENTS FORCED ANOTHER NOBEL PRIZE WINNING MASTER SIR NEVILL MOTT TO RESIGN UP TO ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO IT WAS THOUGHT THAT PROTONS AND NEUTRONS WERE ELEMENTARY PARTICLES BUT EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH PROTONS WERE COLLIDED WITH OTHER PROTONS OR ELECTRONS AT HIGH SPEEDS INDICATED THAT THEY WERE IN FACT MADE UP OF SMALLER PARTICLES THESE PARTICLES WERE NAMED QUARKS BY THE CALTECH PHYSICIST MURRAY GELLMANN WHO WON THE NOBEL PRIZE IN FOR HIS WORK ON THEM THE ORIGIN OF THE NAME IS AN ENIGMATIC QUOTATION FROM JAMES JOYCE THREE QUARKS FOR MUSTER MARK THE WORD QUARK IS SUPPOSED TO BE PRONOUNCED LIKE QUART BUT WITH A K AT THE END INSTEAD OF A T BUT IS USUALLY PRONOUNCED TO RHYME WITH LARK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF QUARKS THERE ARE SIX FLAVORS WHICH WE CALL UP DOWN STRANGE CHARMED BOTTOM AND TOP THE FIRST THREE FLAVORS HAD BEEN KNOWN SINCE THE S BUT THE CHARMED QUARK WAS DISCOVERED ONLY IN  THE BOTTOM IN AND THE TOP IN EACH FLAVOR COMES IN THREE COLORS RED GREEN AND BLUE IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT THESE TERMS ARE JUST LABELS QUARKS ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN THE WAVELENGTH OF VISIBLE LIGHT AND SO DO NOT HAVE ANY COLOR IN THE NORMAL SENSE IT IS JUST THAT MODERN PHYSICISTS SEEM TO HAVE MORE IMAGINATIVE WAYS OF NAMING NEW PARTICLES AND PHENOMENA THEY NO LONGER RESTRICT THEMSELVES TO GREEK A PROTON OR NEUTRON IS MADE UP OF THREE QUARKS ONE OF EACH COLOR A PROTON CONTAINS TWO UP QUARKS AND ONE DOWN QUARK A NEUTRON CONTAINS TWO DOWN AND ONE UP WE CAN CREATE PARTICLES MADE UP OF THE OTHER QUARKS STRANGE CHARMED BOTTOM AND TOP BUT THESE ALL HAVE A MUCH GREATER MASS AND DECAY VERY RAPIDLY INTO PROTONS AND NEUTRONS WE NOW KNOW THAT NEITHER THE ATOMS NOR THE PROTONS AND NEUTRONS WITHIN THEM ARE INDIVISIBLE SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE TRULY ELEMENTARY PARTICLES THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS FROM WHICH EVERYTHING IS MADE SINCE THE WAVELENGTH OF LIGHT IS MUCH LARGER THAN THE SIZE OF AN ATOM WE CANNOT HOPE TO LOOK AT THE PARTS OF AN ATOM IN THE ORDINARY WAY WE NEED TO USE SOMETHING WITH A MUCH SMALLER WAVELENGTH AS WE SAW IN THE LAST CHAPTER QUANTUM MECHANICS TELLS US THAT ALL PARTICLES ARE IN FACT WAVES AND THAT THE HIGHER THE ENERGY OF A PARTICLE THE SMALLER THE WAVELENGTH OF THE CORRESPONDING WAVE SO THE BEST ANSWER WE CAN GIVE TO OUR QUESTION DEPENDS ON HOW HIGH A PARTICLE ENERGY WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL BECAUSE THIS DETERMINES ON HOW SMALL A LENGTH SCALE WE CAN LOOK THESE PARTICLE ENERGIES ARE USUALLY MEASURED IN UNITS CALLED ELECTRON VOLTS IN THOMSONS EXPERIMENTS WITH ELECTRONS WE SAW THAT HE USED AN ELECTRIC FIELD TO ACCELERATE THE ELECTRONS THE ENERGY THAT AN ELECTRON GAINS FROM AN ELECTRIC FIELD OF ONE VOLT IS WHAT IS KNOWN AS AN ELECTRON VOLT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHEN THE ONLY PARTICLE ENERGIES THAT PEOPLE KNEW HOW TO USE WERE THE LOW ENERGIES OF A FEW ELECTRON VOLTS GENERATED BY CHEMICAL REACTIONS SUCH AS BURNING IT WAS THOUGHT THAT ATOMS WERE THE SMALLEST UNIT IN RUTHERFORDS EXPERIMENT THE ALPHAPARTICLES HAD ENERGIES OF MILLIONS OF ELECTRON VOLTS MORE RECENTLY WE HAVE LEARNED HOW TO USE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS TO GIVE PARTICLES ENERGIES OF AT FIRST MILLIONS AND THEN THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF ELECTRON VOLTS AND SO WE KNOW THAT PARTICLES THAT WERE THOUGHT TO BE ELEMENTARY THIRTY YEARS AGO ARE IN FACT MADE UP OF SMALLER PARTICLES MAY THESE AS WE GO TO STILL HIGHER ENERGIES IN TURN BE FOUND TO BE MADE FROM STILL SMALLER PARTICLES THIS IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE BUT WE DO HAVE SOME THEORETICAL REASONS FOR BELIEVING THAT WE HAVE OR ARE VERY NEAR TO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE ULTIMATE BUILDING BLOCKS OF NATURE USING THE WAVEPARTICLE DUALITY DISCUSSED IN THE LAST CHAPTER EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE INCLUDING LIGHT AND GRAVITY CAN BE DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF PARTICLES THESE PARTICLES HAVE A PROPERTY CALLED SPIN ONE WAY OF THINKING OF SPIN IS TO IMAGINE THE PARTICLES AS LITTLE TOPS SPINNING ABOUT AN AXIS HOWEVER THIS CAN BE MISLEADING BECAUSE QUANTUM MECHANICS TELLS US THAT THE PARTICLES DO NOT HAVE ANY WELLDEFINED AXIS WHAT THE SPIN OF A PARTICLE REALLY TELLS US IS WHAT THE PARTICLE LOOKS LIKE FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS A PARTICLE OF SPIN IS LIKE A DOT IT LOOKS THE SAME FROM EVERY DIRECTION FIGURE I ON THE OTHER HAND A PARTICLE OF SPIN IS LIKE AN ARROW IT LOOKS DIFFERENT FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS FIGURE II ONLY IF ONE TURNS IT ROUND A COMPLETE REVOLUTION DEGREES DOES THE PARTICLE LOOK THE SAME A PARTICLE OF SPIN IS LIKE A DOUBLEHEADED ARROW FIGURE III IT LOOKS THE SAME IF ONE TURNS IT ROUND HALF A REVOLUTION DEGREES SIMILARLY HIGHER SPIN PARTICLES LOOK THE SAME IF ONE TURNS THEM THROUGH SMALLER FRACTIONS OF A COMPLETE REVOLUTION ALL THIS SEEMS FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT THE REMARKABLE FACT IS THAT THERE ARE PARTICLES THAT DO NOT LOOK THE SAME IF ONE TURNS THEM THROUGH JUST ONE REVOLUTION YOU HAVE TO TURN THEM THROUGH TWO COMPLETE REVOLUTIONS SUCH PARTICLES ARE SAID TO HAVE SPIN ALL THE KNOWN PARTICLES IN THE UNIVERSE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS PARTICLES OF SPIN  WHICH MAKE UP THE MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE AND PARTICLES OF SPIN AND WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE GIVE RISE TO FORCES BETWEEN THE MATTER PARTICLES THE MATTER PARTICLES OBEY WHAT IS CALLED PAULIS EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE THIS WAS DISCOVERED IN BY AN AUSTRIAN PHYSICIST WOLFGANG PAULI FOR WHICH HE RECEIVED THE NOBEL PRIZE IN HE WAS THE ARCHETYPAL THEORETICAL PHYSICIST IT WAS SAID OF HIM THAT EVEN HIS PRESENCE IN THE SAME TOWN WOULD MAKE EXPERIMENTS GO WRONG PAULIS EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE SAYS THAT TWO SIMILAR PARTICLES CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME STATE THAT IS THEY CANNOT HAVE BOTH THE SAME POSITION AND THE SAME VELOCITY WITHIN THE LIMITS GIVEN BY THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS WHY MATTER PARTICLES DO NOT COLLAPSE TO A STATE OF VERY HIGH DENSITY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE FORCES PRODUCED BY THE PARTICLES OF SPIN AND IF THE MATTER PARTICLES HAVE VERY NEARLY THE SAME POSITIONS THEY MUST HAVE DIFFERENT VELOCITIES WHICH MEANS THAT THEY WILL NOT STAY IN THE SAME POSITION FOR LONG IF THE WORLD HAD BEEN CREATED WITHOUT THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE QUARKS WOULD NOT FORM SEPARATE WELLDEFINED PROTONS AND NEUTRONS NOR WOULD THESE TOGETHER WITH ELECTRONS FORM SEPARATE WELLDEFINED ATOMS THEY WOULD ALL COLLAPSE TO FORM A ROUGHLY UNIFORM DENSE SOUP A PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ELECTRON AND OTHER SPIN PARTICLES DID NOT COME UNTIL WHEN A THEORY WAS PROPOSED BY PAUL DIRAC WHO LATER WAS ELECTED TO THE LUCASIAN PROFESSORSHIP OF MATHEMATICS AT CAMBRIDGE THE SAME PROFESSORSHIP THAT NEWTON HAD ONCE HELD AND THAT I NOW HOLD DIRACS THEORY WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH BOTH QUANTUM MECHANICS AND THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY IT EXPLAINED MATHEMATICALLY WHY THE ELECTRON HAD SPIN THAT IS WHY IT DIDNT LOOK THE SAME IF YOU TURNED IT THROUGH ONLY ONE COMPLETE REVOLUTION BUT DID IF YOU TURNED IT THROUGH TWO REVOLUTIONS IT ALSO PREDICTED THAT THE ELECTRON SHOULD HAVE A PARTNER AN ANTIELECTRON OR POSITRON THE DISCOVERY OF THE POSITRON IN CONFIRMED DIRACS THEORY AND LED TO HIS BEING AWARDED THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR PHYSICS IN  WE NOW KNOW THAT EVERY PARTICLE HAS AN ANTIPARTICLE WITH WHICH IT CAN ANNIHILATE IN THE CASE OF THE FORCECARRYING PARTICLES THE ANTIPARTICLES ARE THE SAME AS THE PARTICLES THEMSELVES THERE COULD BE WHOLE ANTIWORLDS AND ANTIPEOPLE MADE OUT OF ANTIPARTICLES HOWEVER IF YOU MEET YOUR ANTISELF DONT SHAKE HANDS YOU WOULD BOTH VANISH IN A GREAT FLASH OF LIGHT THE QUESTION OF WHY THERE SEEM TO BE SO MANY MORE PARTICLES THAN ANTIPARTICLES AROUND US IS EXTREMELY IN QUANTUM MECHANICS THE FORCES OR INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MATTER PARTICLES ARE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE CARRIED BY PARTICLES OF INTEGER SPIN OR WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT A MATTER PARTICLE SUCH AS AN ELECTRON OR A QUARK EMITS A FORCECARRYING PARTICLE THE RECOIL FROM THIS EMISSION CHANGES THE VELOCITY OF THE MATTER PARTICLE THE FORCECARRYING PARTICLE THEN COLLIDES WITH ANOTHER MATTER PARTICLE AND IS ABSORBED THIS COLLISION CHANGES THE VELOCITY OF THE SECOND PARTICLE JUST AS IF THERE HAD BEEN A FORCE BETWEEN THE TWO MATTER PARTICLES IT IS AN IMPORTANT PROPERTY OF THE FORCECARRYING PARTICLES THAT THEY DO NOT OBEY THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE THIS MEANS THAT THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE NUMBER THAT CAN BE EXCHANGED AND SO THEY CAN GIVE RISE TO A STRONG FORCE HOWEVER IF THE FORCECARRYING PARTICLES HAVE A HIGH MASS IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE AND EXCHANGE THEM OVER A LARGE DISTANCE SO THE FORCES THAT THEY CARRY WILL HAVE ONLY A SHORT RANGE ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE FORCECARRYING PARTICLES HAVE NO MASS OF THEIR OWN THE FORCES WILL BE LONG RANGE THE FORCECARRYING PARTICLES EXCHANGED BETWEEN MATTER PARTICLES ARE SAID TO BE VIRTUAL PARTICLES BECAUSE UNLIKE REAL PARTICLES THEY CANNOT BE DIRECTLY DETECTED BY A PARTICLE DETECTOR WE KNOW THEY EXIST HOWEVER BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE A MEASURABLE EFFECT THEY GIVE RISE TO FORCES BETWEEN MATTER PARTICLES PARTICLES OF SPIN OR DO ALSO EXIST IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES AS REAL PARTICLES WHEN THEY CAN BE DIRECTLY DETECTED THEY THEN APPEAR TO US AS WHAT A CLASSICAL PHYSICIST WOULD CALL WAVES SUCH AS WAVES OF LIGHT OR GRAVITATIONAL WAVES THEY MAY SOMETIMES BE EMITTED WHEN MATTER PARTICLES INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER BY EXCHANGING VIRTUAL FORCECARRYING PARTICLES FOR EXAMPLE THE ELECTRIC REPULSIVE FORCE BETWEEN TWO ELECTRONS IS DUE TO THE EXCHANGE OF VIRTUAL PHOTONS WHICH CAN NEVER BE DIRECTLY DETECTED BUT IF ONE ELECTRON MOVES PAST ANOTHER REAL PHOTONS MAY BE GIVEN OFF WHICH WE DETECT AS LIGHT WAVES FORCECARRYING PARTICLES CAN BE GROUPED INTO FOUR CATEGORIES ACCORDING TO THE STRENGTH OF THE FORCE THAT THEY CARRY AND THE PARTICLES WITH WHICH THEY INTERACT IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT THIS DIVISION INTO FOUR CLASSES IS MANMADE IT IS CONVENIENT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF PARTIAL THEORIES BUT IT MAY NOT CORRESPOND TO ANYTHING DEEPER ULTIMATELY MOST PHYSICISTS HOPE TO FIND A UNIFIED THEORY THAT WILL EXPLAIN ALL FOUR FORCES AS DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF A SINGLE FORCE INDEED MANY WOULD SAY THIS IS THE PRIME GOAL OF PHYSICS TODAY RECENTLY SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO UNIFY THREE OF THE FOUR CATEGORIES OF FORCE AND I SHALL DESCRIBE THESE IN THIS CHAPTER THE QUESTION OF THE UNIFICATION OF THE REMAINING CATEGORY GRAVITY WE SHALL LEAVE TILL LATER THE FIRST CATEGORY IS THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE THIS FORCE IS UNIVERSAL THAT IS EVERY PARTICLE FEELS THE FORCE OF GRAVITY ACCORDING TO ITS MASS OR ENERGY GRAVITY IS THE WEAKEST OF THE FOUR FORCES BY A LONG WAY IT IS SO WEAK THAT WE WOULD NOT NOTICE IT AT ALL WERE IT NOT FOR TWO SPECIAL PROPERTIES THAT IT HAS IT CAN ACT OVER LARGE DISTANCES AND IT IS ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE THIS MEANS THAT THE VERY WEAK GRAVITATIONAL FORCES BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL PARTICLES IN TWO LARGE BODIES SUCH AS THE EARTH AND THE SUN CAN ALL ADD UP TO PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT FORCE THE OTHER THREE FORCES ARE EITHER SHORT RANGE OR ARE SOMETIMES ATTRACTIVE AND SOMETIMES REPULSIVE SO THEY TEND TO CANCEL OUT IN THE QUANTUM MECHANICAL WAY OF LOOKING AT THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD THE FORCE BETWEEN TWO MATTER PARTICLES IS PICTURED AS BEING CARRIED BY A PARTICLE OF SPIN CALLED THE GRAVITON THIS HAS NO MASS OF ITS OWN SO THE FORCE THAT IT CARRIES IS LONG RANGE THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE BETWEEN THE SUN AND THE EARTH IS ASCRIBED TO THE EXCHANGE OF GRAVITONS BETWEEN THE PARTICLES THAT MAKE UP THESE TWO BODIES ALTHOUGH THE EXCHANGED PARTICLES ARE VIRTUAL THEY CERTAINLY DO PRODUCE A MEASURABLE EFFECT THEY MAKE THE EARTH ORBIT THE SUN REAL GRAVITONS MAKE UP WHAT CLASSICAL PHYSICISTS WOULD CALL GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WHICH ARE VERY WEAK AND SO DIFFICULT TO DETECT THAT THEY HAVE NOT YET BEEN OBSERVED THE NEXT CATEGORY IS THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE WHICH INTERACTS WITH ELECTRICALLY CHARGED PARTICLES LIKE ELECTRONS AND QUARKS BUT NOT WITH UNCHARGED PARTICLES SUCH AS GRAVITONS IT IS MUCH STRONGER THAN THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE BETWEEN TWO ELECTRONS IS ABOUT A MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION WITH FORTYTWO ZEROS AFTER IT TIMES BIGGER THAN THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE HOWEVER THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF ELECTRIC CHARGE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE THE FORCE BETWEEN TWO POSITIVE CHARGES IS REPULSIVE AS IS THE FORCE BETWEEN TWO NEGATIVE CHARGES BUT THE FORCE IS ATTRACTIVE BETWEEN A POSITIVE AND A NEGATIVE CHARGE A LARGE BODY SUCH AS THE EARTH OR THE SUN CONTAINS NEARLY EQUAL NUMBERS OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CHARGES THUS THE ATTRACTIVE AND REPULSIVE FORCES BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL PARTICLES NEARLY CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE NET ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE HOWEVER ON THE SMALL SCALES OF ATOMS AND MOLECULES ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCES DOMINATE THE ELECTROMAGNETIC ATTRACTION BETWEEN NEGATIVELY CHARGED ELECTRONS AND POSITIVELY CHARGED PROTONS IN THE NUCLEUS CAUSES THE ELECTRONS TO ORBIT THE NUCLEUS OF THE ATOM JUST AS GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION CAUSES THE EARTH TO ORBIT THE SUN THE ELECTROMAGNETIC ATTRACTION IS PICTURED AS BEING CAUSED BY THE EXCHANGE OF LARGE NUMBERS OF VIRTUAL MASSLESS PARTICLES OF SPIN CALLED PHOTONS AGAIN THE PHOTONS THAT ARE EXCHANGED ARE VIRTUAL PARTICLES HOWEVER WHEN AN ELECTRON CHANGES FROM ONE ALLOWED ORBIT TO ANOTHER ONE NEARER TO THE NUCLEUS ENERGY IS RELEASED AND A REAL PHOTON IS EMITTED WHICH CAN BE OBSERVED AS VISIBLE LIGHT BY THE HUMAN EYE IF IT HAS THE RIGHT WAVELENGTH OR BY A PHOTON DETECTOR SUCH AS PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM EQUALLY IF A REAL PHOTON COLLIDES WITH AN ATOM IT MAY MOVE AN ELECTRON FROM AN ORBIT NEARER THE NUCLEUS TO ONE FARTHER AWAY THIS USES UP THE ENERGY OF THE PHOTON SO IT IS ABSORBED THE THIRD CATEGORY IS CALLED THE WEAK NUCLEAR FORCE WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RADIOACTIVITY AND WHICH ACTS ON ALL MATTER PARTICLES OF SPIN BUT NOT ON PARTICLES OF SPIN OR SUCH AS PHOTONS AND GRAVITONS THE WEAK NUCLEAR FORCE WAS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD UNTIL WHEN ABDUS SALAM AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON AND STEVEN WEINBERG AT HARVARD BOTH PROPOSED THEORIES THAT UNIFIED THIS INTERACTION WITH THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE JUST AS MAXWELL HAD UNIFIED ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER THEY SUGGESTED THAT IN ADDITION TO THE PHOTON THERE WERE THREE OTHER SPIN  PARTICLES KNOWN COLLECTIVELY AS MASSIVE VECTOR BOSONS THAT CARRIED THE WEAK FORCE THESE WERE CALLED W PRONOUNCED W PLUS W PRONOUNCED W MINUS AND Z PRONOUNCED Z NAUGHT AND EACH HAD A MASS OF AROUND GEV GEV STANDS FOR GIGAELECTRONVOLT OR ONE THOUSAND MILLION ELECTRON VOLTS THE WEINBERGSALAM THEORY EXHIBITS A PROPERTY KNOWN AS SPONTANEOUS SYMMETRY BREAKING THIS MEANS THAT WHAT APPEAR TO BE A NUMBER OF COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PARTICLES AT LOW ENERGIES ARE IN FACT FOUND TO BE ALL THE SAME TYPE OF PARTICLE ONLY IN DIFFERENT STATES AT HIGH ENERGIES ALL THESE PARTICLES BEHAVE SIMILARLY THE EFFECT IS RATHER LIKE THE BEHAVIOR OF A ROULETTE BALL ON A ROULETTE WHEEL AT HIGH ENERGIES WHEN THE WHEEL IS SPUN QUICKLY THE BALL BEHAVES IN ESSENTIALLY ONLY ONE WAY IT ROLLS ROUND AND ROUND BUT AS THE WHEEL SLOWS THE ENERGY OF THE BALL DECREASES AND EVENTUALLY THE BALL DROPS INTO ONE OF THE THIRTYSEVEN SLOTS IN THE WHEEL IN OTHER WORDS AT LOW ENERGIES THERE ARE THIRTYSEVEN DIFFERENT STATES IN WHICH THE BALL CAN EXIST IF FOR SOME REASON WE COULD ONLY OBSERVE THE BALL AT LOW ENERGIES WE WOULD THEN THINK THAT THERE WERE THIRTYSEVEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF BALL IN THE WEINBERGSALAM THEORY AT ENERGIES MUCH GREATER THAN GEV THE THREE NEW PARTICLES AND THE PHOTON WOULD ALL BEHAVE IN A SIMILAR MANNER BUT AT THE LOWER PARTICLE ENERGIES THAT OCCUR IN MOST NORMAL SITUATIONS THIS SYMMETRY BETWEEN THE PARTICLES WOULD BE BROKEN WE W AND Z WOULD ACQUIRE LARGE MASSES MAKING THE FORCES THEY CARRY HAVE A VERY SHORT RANGE AT THE TIME THAT SALAM AND WEINBERG PROPOSED THEIR THEORY FEW PEOPLE BELIEVED THEM AND PARTICLE ACCELERATORS WERE NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH TO REACH THE ENERGIES OF GEV REQUIRED TO PRODUCE REAL W W OR Z PARTICLES HOWEVER OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS OR SO THE OTHER PREDICTIONS OF THE THEORY AT LOWER ENERGIES AGREED SO WELL WITH EXPERIMENT THAT IN SALAM AND WEINBERG WERE AWARDED THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR PHYSICS TOGETHER WITH SHELDON GLASHOW ALSO AT HARVARD WHO HAD SUGGESTED SIMILAR UNIFIED THEORIES OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC AND WEAK NUCLEAR FORCES THE NOBEL COMMITTEE WAS SPARED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF HAVING MADE A MISTAKE BY THE DISCOVERY IN AT CERN EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR NUCLEAR RESEARCH OF THE THREE MASSIVE PARTNERS OF THE PHOTON WITH THE CORRECT PREDICTED MASSES AND OTHER PROPERTIES CARLO RUBBIA WHO LED THE TEAM OF SEVERAL HUNDRED PHYSICISTS THAT MADE THE DISCOVERY RECEIVED THE NOBEL PRIZE IN ALONG WITH SIMON VAN DER MEER THE CERNENGINEER WHO DEVELOPED THE ANTIMATTER STORAGE SYSTEM EMPLOYED IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE A MARK IN EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS THESE DAYS UNLESS YOU ARE ALREADY AT THE TOP  THE FOURTH CATEGORY IS THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE WHICH HOLDS THE QUARKS TOGETHER IN THE PROTON AND NEUTRON AND HOLDS THE PROTONS AND NEUTRONS TOGETHER IN THE NUCLEUS OF AN ATOM IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS FORCE IS CARRIED BY ANOTHER SPIN PARTICLE CALLED THE GLUON WHICH INTERACTS ONLY WITH ITSELF AND WITH THE QUARKS THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE HAS A CURIOUS PROPERTY CALLED CONFINEMENT IT ALWAYS BINDS PARTICLES TOGETHER INTO COMBINATIONS THAT HAVE NO COLOR ONE CANNOT HAVE A SINGLE QUARK ON ITS OWN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE A COLOR RED GREEN OR BLUE INSTEAD A RED QUARK HAS TO BE JOINED TO A GREEN AND A BLUE QUARK BY A STRING OF GLUONS RED GREEN BLUE WHITE SUCH A TRIPLET CONSTITUTES A PROTON OR A NEUTRON ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS A PAIR CONSISTING OF A QUARK AND AN ANTIQUARK RED ANTIRED OR GREEN ANTIGREEN OR BLUE ANTIBLUE WHITE SUCH COMBINATIONS MAKE UP THE PARTICLES KNOWN AS MESONS WHICH ARE UNSTABLE BECAUSE THE QUARK AND ANTIQUARK CAN ANNIHILATE EACH OTHER PRODUCING ELECTRONS AND OTHER PARTICLES SIMILARLY CONFINEMENT PREVENTS ONE HAVING A SINGLE GLUON ON ITS OWN BECAUSE GLUONS ALSO HAVE COLOR INSTEAD ONE HAS TO HAVE A COLLECTION OF GLUONS WHOSE COLORS ADD UP TO WHITE SUCH A COLLECTION FORMS AN UNSTABLE PARTICLE CALLED A GLUEBALL THE FACT THAT CONFINEMENT PREVENTS ONE FROM OBSERVING AN ISOLATED QUARK OR GLUON MIGHT SEEM TO MAKE THE WHOLE NOTION OF QUARKS AND GLUONS AS PARTICLES SOMEWHAT METAPHYSICAL HOWEVER THERE IS ANOTHER PROPERTY OF THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE CALLED ASYMPTOTIC FREEDOM THAT MAKES THE CONCEPT OF QUARKS AND GLUONS WELL DEFINED AT NORMAL ENERGIES THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE IS INDEED STRONG AND IT BINDS THE QUARKS TIGHTLY TOGETHER HOWEVER EXPERIMENTS WITH LARGE PARTICLE ACCELERATORS INDICATE THAT AT HIGH ENERGIES THE STRONG FORCE BECOMES MUCH WEAKER AND THE QUARKS AND GLUONS BEHAVE ALMOST LIKE FREE PARTICLES SHOWS A PHOTOGRAPH OF A COLLISION BETWEEN A HIGHENERGY PROTON AND ANTIPROTON THE SUCCESS OF THE UNIFICATION OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC AND WEAK NUCLEAR FORCES LED TO A NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS TO COMBINE THESE TWO FORCES WITH THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE INTO WHAT IS CALLED A GRAND UNIFIED THEORY OR GUT THIS TITLE IS RATHER AN EXAGGERATION THE RESULTANT THEORIES ARE NOT ALL THAT GRAND NOR ARE THEY FULLY UNIFIED AS THEY DO NOT INCLUDE GRAVITY NOR ARE THEY REALLY COMPLETE THEORIES BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN A NUMBER OF PARAMETERS WHOSE VALUES CANNOT BE PREDICTED FROM THE THEORY BUT HAVE TO BE CHOSEN TO FIT IN WITH EXPERIMENT NEVERTHELESS THEY MAY BE A STEP TOWARD A COMPLETE FULLY UNIFIED THEORY THE BASIC IDEA OF GUTS IS AS FOLLOWS AS WAS MENTIONED ABOVE THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE GETS WEAKER AT HIGH ENERGIES ON THE OTHER HAND THE ELECTROMAGNETIC AND WEAK FORCES WHICH ARE NOT ASYMPTOTICALLY FREE GET STRONGER AT HIGH ENERGIES AT SOME VERY HIGH ENERGY CALLED THE GRAND UNIFICATION ENERGY THESE THREE FORCES WOULD ALL HAVE THE SAME STRENGTH AND SO COULD JUST BE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF A SINGLE FORCE THE GUTS ALSO PREDICT THAT AT THIS ENERGY THE DIFFERENT SPIN MATTER PARTICLES LIKE QUARKS AND ELECTRONS WOULD ALSO ALL BE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THUS ACHIEVING ANOTHER UNIFICATION THE VALUE OF THE GRAND UNIFICATION ENERGY IS NOT VERY WELL KNOWN BUT IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO BE AT LEAST A THOUSAND MILLION MILLION GEV THE PRESENT GENERATION OF PARTICLE ACCELERATORS CAN COLLIDE PARTICLES AT ENERGIES OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED GEV AND MACHINES ARE PLANNED THAT WOULD RAISE THIS TO A FEW THOUSAND GEV BUT A MACHINE THAT WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ACCELERATE PARTICLES TO THE GRAND UNIFICATION ENERGY WOULD HAVE TO BE AS BIG AS THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO BE FUNDED IN THE PRESENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE THUS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TEST GRAND UNIFIED THEORIES DIRECTLY IN THE LABORATORY HOWEVER JUST AS IN THE CASE OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC AND WEAK UNIFIED THEORY THERE ARE LOWENERGY CONSEQUENCES OF THE THEORY THAT CAN BE TESTED THE MOST INTERESTING OF THESE IS THE PREDICTION THAT PROTONS WHICH MAKE UP MUCH OF THE MASS OF ORDINARY MATTER CAN SPONTANEOUSLY DECAY INTO LIGHTER PARTICLES SUCH AS ANTIELECTRONS THE REASON THIS IS POSSIBLE IS THAT AT THE GRAND UNIFICATION ENERGY THERE IS NO ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A QUARK AND AN ANTIELECTRON THE THREE QUARKS INSIDE A PROTON NORMALLY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO CHANGE INTO ANTIELECTRONS BUT VERY OCCASIONALLY ONE OF THEM MAY ACQUIRE SUFFICIENT ENERGY TO MAKE THE TRANSITION BECAUSE THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE MEANS THAT THE ENERGY OF THE QUARKS INSIDE THE PROTON CANNOT BE FIXED EXACTLY THE PROTON WOULD THEN DECAY THE PROBABILITY OF A QUARK GAINING SUFFICIENT ENERGY IS SO LOW THAT ONE IS LIKELY TO HAVE TO WAIT AT LEAST A MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION YEARS FOLLOWED BY THIRTY ZEROS THIS IS MUCH LONGER THAN THE TIME SINCE THE BIG BANG WHICH IS A MERE TEN THOUSAND MILLION YEARS OR SO FOLLOWED BY TEN ZEROS THUS ONE MIGHT THINK THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF SPONTANEOUS PROTON DECAY COULD NOT BE TESTED EXPERIMENTALLY HOWEVER ONE CAN INCREASE ONES CHANCES OF DETECTING A DECAY BY OBSERVING A LARGE AMOUNT OF MATTER CONTAINING A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PROTONS IF FOR EXAMPLE ONE OBSERVED A NUMBER OF PROTONS EQUAL TO FOLLOWED BY THIRTYONE ZEROS FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR ONE WOULD EXPECT ACCORDING TO THE SIMPLEST GUT TO OBSERVE MORE THAN ONE PROTON DECAY A NUMBER OF SUCH EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BUT NONE HAVE YIELDED DEFINITE EVIDENCE OF PROTON OR NEUTRON DECAY ONE EXPERIMENT USED EIGHT THOUSAND TONS OF WATER AND WAS PERFORMED IN THE MORTON SALT MINE IN OHIO TO AVOID OTHER EVENTS TAKING PLACE CAUSED BY COSMIC RAYS THAT MIGHT BE CONFUSED WITH PROTON DECAY SINCE NO SPONTANEOUS PROTON DECAY HAD BEEN OBSERVED DURING THE EXPERIMENT ONE CAN CALCULATE THAT THE PROBABLE LIFE OF THE PROTON MUST BE GREATER THAN TEN MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION YEARS WITH THIRTYONE ZEROS THIS IS LONGER THAN THE LIFETIME PREDICTED BY THE SIMPLEST GRAND UNIFIED THEORY BUT THERE ARE MORE ELABORATE THEORIES IN WHICH THE PREDICTED LIFETIMES ARE LONGER STILL MORE SENSITIVE EXPERIMENTS INVOLVING EVEN LARGER QUANTITIES OF MATTER WILL BE NEEDED TO TEST THEM EVEN THOUGH IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO OBSERVE SPONTANEOUS PROTON DECAY IT MAY BE THAT OUR VERY EXISTENCE IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE REVERSE PROCESS THE PRODUCTION OF PROTONS OR MORE SIMPLY OF QUARKS FROM AN INITIAL SITUATION IN WHICH THERE WERE NO MORE QUARKS THAN ANTIQUARKS WHICH IS THE MOST NATURAL WAY TO IMAGINE THE UNIVERSE STARTING OUT MATTER ON THE EARTH IS MADE UP MAINLY OF PROTONS AND NEUTRONS WHICH IN TURN ARE MADE UP OF QUARKS THERE ARE NO ANTIPROTONS OR ANTINEUTRONS MADE UP FROM ANTIQUARKS EXCEPT FOR A FEW THAT PHYSICISTS PRODUCE IN LARGE PARTICLE ACCELERATORS WE HAVE EVIDENCE FROM COSMIC RAYS THAT THE SAME IS TRUE FOR ALL THE MATTER IN OUR GALAXY THERE ARE NO ANTIPROTONS OR ANTINEUTRONS APART FROM A SMALL NUMBER THAT ARE PRODUCED AS PARTICLE ANTIPARTICLE PAIRS IN HIGHENERGY COLLISIONS IF THERE WERE LARGE REGIONS OF ANTIMATTER IN OUR GALAXY WE WOULD EXPECT TO OBSERVE LARGE QUANTITIES OF RADIATION FROM THE BORDERS BETWEEN THE REGIONS OF MATTER AND ANTIMATTER WHERE MANY PARTICLES WOULD BE COLLIDING WITH THEIR ANTIPARTICLES ANNIHILATING EACH OTHER AND GIVING OFF HIGHENERGY RADIATION WE HAVE NO DIRECT EVIDENCE AS TO WHETHER THE MATTER IN OTHER GALAXIES IS MADE UP OF PROTONS AND NEUTRONS OR ANTIPROTONS AND ANTINEUTRONS BUT IT MUST BE ONE OR THE OTHER THERE CANNOT BE A MIXTURE IN A SINGLE GALAXY BECAUSE IN THAT CASE WE WOULD AGAIN OBSERVE A LOT OF RADIATION FROM ANNIHILATIONS WE THEREFORE BELIEVE THAT ALL GALAXIES ARE COMPOSED OF QUARKS RATHER THAN ANTIQUARKS IT SEEMS IMPLAUSIBLE THAT SOME GALAXIES SHOULD BE MATTER AND SOME ANTIMATTER WHY SHOULD THERE BE SO MANY MORE QUARKS THAN ANTIQUARKS WHY ARE THERE NOT EQUAL NUMBERS OF EACH IT IS CERTAINLY FORTUNATE FOR US THAT THE NUMBERS ARE UNEQUAL BECAUSE IF THEY HAD BEEN THE SAME NEARLY ALL THE QUARKS AND ANTIQUARKS WOULD HAVE ANNIHILATED EACH OTHER IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE AND LEFT A UNIVERSE FILLED WITH RADIATION BUT HARDLY ANY MATTER THERE WOULD THEN HAVE BEEN NO GALAXIES STARS OR PLANETS ON WHICH HUMAN LIFE COULD HAVE DEVELOPED LUCKILY GRAND UNIFIED THEORIES MAY PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION OF WHY THE UNIVERSE SHOULD NOW CONTAIN MORE QUARKS THAN ANTIQUARKS EVEN IF IT STARTED OUT WITH EQUAL NUMBERS OF EACH AS WE HAVE SEEN GUTS ALLOW QUARKS TO CHANGE INTO ANTIELECTRONS AT HIGH ENERGY THEY ALSO ALLOW THE REVERSE PROCESSES ANTIQUARKS TURNING INTO ELECTRONS AND ELECTRONS AND ANTIELECTRONS TURNING INTO ANTIQUARKS AND QUARKS THERE WAS A TIME IN THE VERY EARLY UNIVERSE WHEN IT WAS SO HOT THAT THE PARTICLE ENERGIES WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGH ENOUGH FOR THESE TRANSFORMATIONS TO TAKE PLACE BUT WHY SHOULD THAT LEAD TO MORE QUARKS THAN ANTIQUARKS THE REASON IS THAT THE LAWS OF PHYSICS ARE NOT QUITE THE SAME FOR PARTICLES AND ANTIPARTICLES UP TO IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE LAWS OF PHYSICS OBEYED EACH OF THREE SEPARATE SYMMETRIES CALLED C P AND T THE SYMMETRY C MEANS THAT THE LAWS ARE THE SAME FOR PARTICLES AND ANTIPARTICLES THE SYMMETRY P MEANS THAT THE LAWS ARE THE SAME FOR ANY SITUATION AND ITS MIRROR IMAGE THE MIRROR IMAGE OF A PARTICLE SPINNING IN A RIGHTHANDED DIRECTION IS ONE SPINNING IN A LEFTHANDED DIRECTION THE SYMMETRY T MEANS THAT IF YOU REVERSE THE DIRECTION OF MOTION OF ALL PARTICLES AND ANTIPARTICLES THE SYSTEM SHOULD GO BACK TO WHAT IT WAS AT EARLIER TIMES IN OTHER WORDS THE LAWS ARE THE SAME IN THE FORWARD AND BACKWARD DIRECTIONS OF TIME IN TWO AMERICAN PHYSICISTS TSUNGDAO LEE AND CHEN NING YANG SUGGESTED THAT THE WEAK FORCE DOES NOT IN FACT OBEY THE SYMMETRY P IN OTHER WORDS THE WEAK FORCE WOULD MAKE THE UNIVERSE DEVELOP IN A DIFFERENT WAY FROM THE WAY IN WHICH THE MIRROR IMAGE OF THE UNIVERSE WOULD DEVELOP THE SAME YEAR A COLLEAGUE CHIENSHIUNG WU PROVED THEIR PREDICTION CORRECT SHE DID THIS BY LINING UP THE NUCLEI OF RADIOACTIVE ATOMS IN A MAGNETIC FIELD SO THAT THEY WERE ALL SPINNING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND SHOWED THAT THE ELECTRONS WERE GIVEN OFF MORE IN ONE DIRECTION THAN ANOTHER THE FOLLOWING YEAR LEE AND YANG RECEIVED THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR THEIR IDEA IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT THE WEAK FORCE DID NOT OBEY THE SYMMETRY C THAT IS IT WOULD CAUSE A UNIVERSE COMPOSED OF ANTIPARTICLES TO BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY FROM OUR UNIVERSE NEVERTHELESS IT SEEMED THAT THE WEAK FORCE DID OBEY THE COMBINED SYMMETRY CP THAT IS THE UNIVERSE WOULD DEVELOP IN THE SAME WAY AS ITS MIRROR IMAGE IF IN ADDITION EVERY PARTICLE WAS SWAPPED WITH ITS ANTIPARTICLE HOWEVER IN TWO MORE AMERICANS J W CRONIN AND VAL FITCH DISCOVERED THAT EVEN THE CP SYMMETRY WAS NOT OBEYED IN THE DECAY OF CERTAIN PARTICLES CALLED KMESONS CRONIN AND FITCH EVENTUALLY RECEIVED THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR THEIR WORK IN A LOT OF PRIZES HAVE BEEN AWARDED FOR SHOWING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS WE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THERE IS A MATHEMATICAL THEOREM THAT SAYS THAT ANY THEORY THAT OBEYS QUANTUM MECHANICS AND RELATIVITY MUST ALWAYS OBEY THE COMBINED SYMMETRY CPT IN OTHER WORDS THE UNIVERSE WOULD HAVE TO BEHAVE THE SAME IF ONE REPLACED PARTICLES BY ANTIPARTICLES TOOK THE MIRROR IMAGE AND ALSO REVERSED THE DIRECTION OF TIME BUT CRONIN AND FITCH SHOWED THAT IF ONE REPLACES PARTICLES BY ANTIPARTICLES AND TAKES THE MIRROR IMAGE BUT DOES NOT REVERSE THE DIRECTION OF TIME THEN THE UNIVERSE DOES NOT BEHAVE THE SAME THE LAWS OF PHYSICS THEREFORE MUST CHANGE IF ONE REVERSES THE DIRECTION OF TIME  THEY DO NOT OBEY THE SYMMETRY T CERTAINLY THE EARLY UNIVERSE DOES NOT OBEY THE SYMMETRY T AS TIME RUNS FORWARD THE UNIVERSE EXPANDS IF IT RAN BACKWARD THE UNIVERSE WOULD BE CONTRACTING AND SINCE THERE ARE FORCES THAT DO NOT OBEY THE SYMMETRY T IT FOLLOWS THAT AS THE UNIVERSE EXPANDS THESE FORCES COULD CAUSE MORE ANTIELECTRONS TO TURN INTO QUARKS THAN ELECTRONS INTO ANTIQUARKS THEN AS THE UNIVERSE EXPANDED AND COOLED THE ANTIQUARKS WOULD ANNIHILATE WITH THE QUARKS BUT SINCE THERE WOULD BE MORE QUARKS THAN ANTIQUARKS A SMALL EXCESS OF QUARKS WOULD REMAIN IT IS THESE THAT MAKE UP THE MATTER WE SEE TODAY AND OUT OF WHICH WE OURSELVES ARE MADE THUS OUR VERY EXISTENCE COULD BE REGARDED AS A CONFIRMATION OF GRAND UNIFIED THEORIES THOUGH A QUALITATIVE ONE ONLY THE UNCERTAINTIES ARE SUCH THAT ONE CANNOT PREDICT THE NUMBERS OF QUARKS THAT WILL BE LEFT AFTER THE ANNIHILATION OR EVEN WHETHER IT WOULD BE QUARKS OR ANTIQUARKS THAT WOULD REMAIN HAD IT BEEN AN EXCESS OF ANTIQUARKS HOWEVER WE WOULD SIMPLY HAVE NAMED ANTIQUARKS QUARKS AND QUARKS ANTIQUARKS GRAND UNIFIED THEORIES DO NOT INCLUDE THE FORCE OF GRAVITY THIS DOES NOT MATTER TOO MUCH BECAUSE GRAVITY IS SUCH A WEAK FORCE THAT ITS EFFECTS CAN USUALLY BE NEGLECTED WHEN WE ARE DEALING WITH ELEMENTARY PARTICLES OR ATOMS HOWEVER THE FACT THAT IT IS BOTH LONG RANGE AND ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE MEANS THAT ITS EFFECTS ALL ADD UP SO FOR A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE NUMBER OF MATTER PARTICLES GRAVITATIONAL FORCES CAN DOMINATE OVER ALL OTHER FORCES THIS IS WHY IT IS GRAVITY THAT DETERMINES THE EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE EVEN FOR OBJECTS THE SIZE OF STARS THE ATTRACTIVE FORCE OF GRAVITY CAN WIN OVER ALL THE OTHER FORCES AND CAUSE THE STAR TO COLLAPSE MY WORK IN THE S FOCUSED ON THE BLACK HOLES THAT CAN RESULT FROM SUCH STELLAR COLLAPSE AND THE INTENSE GRAVITATIONAL FIELDS AROUND THEM IT WAS THIS THAT LED TO THE FIRST HINTS OF HOW THE THEORIES OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND GENERAL RELATIVITY MIGHT AFFECT EACH OTHER A GLIMPSE OF THE SHAPE OF A QUANTUM THEORY OF GRAVITY YET TO COME THE TERM BLACK HOLE IS OF VERY RECENT ORIGIN IT WAS COINED IN BY THE AMERICAN SCIENTIST JOHN WHEELER AS A GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF AN IDEA THAT GOES BACK AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED YEARS TO A TIME WHEN THERE WERE TWO THEORIES ABOUT LIGHT ONE WHICH NEWTON FAVORED WAS THAT IT WAS COMPOSED OF PARTICLES THE OTHER WAS THAT IT WAS MADE OF WAVES WE NOW KNOW THAT REALLY BOTH THEORIES ARE CORRECT BY THE WAVEPARTICLE DUALITY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS LIGHT CAN BE REGARDED AS BOTH A WAVE AND A PARTICLE UNDER THE THEORY THAT LIGHT IS MADE UP OF WAVES IT WAS NOT CLEAR HOW IT WOULD RESPOND TO GRAVITY BUT IF LIGHT IS COMPOSED OF PARTICLES ONE MIGHT EXPECT THEM TO BE AFFECTED BY GRAVITY IN THE SAME WAY THAT CANNONBALLS ROCKETS AND PLANETS ARE AT FIRST PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT PARTICLES OF LIGHT TRAVELED INFINITELY FAST SO GRAVITY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SLOW THEM DOWN BUT THE DISCOVERY BY ROEMER THAT LIGHT TRAVELS AT A FINITE SPEED MEANT THAT GRAVITY MIGHT HAVE AN IMPORTANT EFFECT ON THIS ASSUMPTION A CAMBRIDGE DON JOHN MICHELL WROTE A PAPER IN IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON IN WHICH HE POINTED OUT THAT A STAR THAT WAS SUFFICIENTLY MASSIVE AND COMPACT WOULD HAVE SUCH A STRONG GRAVITATIONAL FIELD THAT LIGHT COULD NOT ESCAPE ANY LIGHT EMITTED FROM THE SURFACE OF THE STAR WOULD BE DRAGGED BACK BY THE STARS GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION BEFORE IT COULD GET VERY FAR MICHELL SUGGESTED THAT THERE MIGHT BE A LARGE NUMBER OF STARS LIKE THIS ALTHOUGH WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE THEM BECAUSE THE LIGHT FROM THEM WOULD NOT REACH US WE WOULD STILL FEEL THEIR GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION SUCH OBJECTS ARE WHAT WE NOW CALL BLACK HOLES BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE BLACK VOIDS IN SPACE A SIMILAR SUGGESTION WAS MADE A FEW YEARS LATER BY THE FRENCH SCIENTIST THE MARQUIS DE LAPLACE APPARENTLY INDEPENDENTLY OF MICHELL INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH LAPLACE INCLUDED IT IN ONLY THE FIRST AND SECOND EDITIONS OF HIS BOOK THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD AND LEFT IT OUT OF LATER EDITIONS PERHAPS HE DECIDED THAT IT WAS A CRAZY IDEA ALSO THE PARTICLE THEORY OF LIGHT WENT OUT OF FAVOR DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT SEEMED THAT EVERYTHING COULD BE EXPLAINED BY THE WAVE THEORY AND ACCORDING TO THE WAVE THEORY IT WAS NOT CLEAR THAT LIGHT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY GRAVITY AT ALL IN FACT IT IS NOT REALLY CONSISTENT TO TREAT LIGHT LIKE CANNONBALLS IN NEWTONS THEORY OF GRAVITY BECAUSE THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS FIXED A CANNONBALL FIRED UPWARD FROM THE EARTH WILL BE SLOWED DOWN BY GRAVITY AND WILL EVENTUALLY STOP AND FALL BACK A PHOTON HOWEVER MUST CONTINUE UPWARD AT A CONSTANT SPEED HOW THEN CAN NEWTONIAN GRAVITY AFFECT LIGHT A CONSISTENT THEORY OF HOW GRAVITY AFFECTS LIGHT DID NOT COME ALONG UNTIL EINSTEIN PROPOSED GENERAL RELATIVITY IN AND EVEN THEN IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE THEORY FOR MASSIVE STARS WERE UNDERSTOOD TO UNDERSTAND HOW A BLACK HOLE MIGHT BE FORMED WE FIRST NEED AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIFE CYCLE OF A STAR A STAR IS FORMED WHEN A LARGE AMOUNT OF GAS MOSTLY HYDROGEN STARTS TO COLLAPSE IN ON ITSELF DUE TO ITS GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION AS IT CONTRACTS THE ATOMS OF THE GAS COLLIDE WITH EACH OTHER MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY AND AT GREATER AND GREATER SPEEDS  THE GAS HEATS UP EVENTUALLY THE GAS WILL BE SO HOT THAT WHEN THE HYDROGEN ATOMS COLLIDE THEY NO LONGER BOUNCE OFF EACH OTHER BUT INSTEAD COALESCE TO FORM HELIUM THE HEAT RELEASED IN THIS REACTION WHICH IS LIKE A CONTROLLED HYDROGEN BOMB EXPLOSION IS WHAT MAKES THE STAR SHINE THIS ADDITIONAL HEAT ALSO INCREASES THE PRESSURE OF THE GAS UNTIL IT IS SUFFICIENT TO BALANCE THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION AND THE GAS STOPS CONTRACTING IT IS A BIT LIKE A BALLOON THERE IS A BALANCE BETWEEN THE PRESSURE OF THE AIR INSIDE WHICH IS TRYING TO MAKE THE BALLOON EXPAND AND THE TENSION IN THE RUBBER WHICH IS TRYING TO MAKE THE BALLOON SMALLER STARS WILL REMAIN STABLE LIKE THIS FOR A LONG TIME WITH HEAT FROM THE NUCLEAR REACTIONS BALANCING THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION EVENTUALLY HOWEVER THE STAR WILL RUN OUT OF ITS HYDROGEN AND OTHER NUCLEAR FUELS PARADOXICALLY THE MORE FUEL A STAR STARTS OFF WITH THE SOONER IT RUNS OUT THIS IS BECAUSE THE MORE MASSIVE THE STAR IS THE HOTTER IT NEEDS TO BE TO BALANCE ITS GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION AND THE HOTTER IT IS THE FASTER IT WILL USE UP ITS FUEL OUR SUN HAS PROBABLY GOT ENOUGH FUEL FOR ANOTHER FIVE THOUSAND MILLION YEARS OR SO BUT MORE MASSIVE STARS CAN USE UP THEIR FUEL IN AS LITTLE AS ONE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS MUCH LESS THAN THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE WHEN A STAR RUNS OUT OF FUEL IT STARTS TO COOL OFF AND SO TO CONTRACT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO IT THEN WAS FIRST UNDERSTOOD ONLY AT THE END OF THE S IN AN INDIAN GRADUATE STUDENT SUBRAHMANYAN CHANDRASEKHAR SET SAIL FOR ENGLAND TO STUDY AT CAMBRIDGE WITH THE BRITISH ASTRONOMER SIR ARTHUR EDDINGTON AN EXPERT ON GENERAL RELATIVITY ACCORDING TO SOME ACCOUNTS A JOURNALIST TOLD EDDINGTON IN THE EARLY S THAT HE HAD HEARD THERE WERE ONLY THREE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO UNDERSTOOD GENERAL RELATIVITY EDDINGTON PAUSED THEN REPLIED I AM TRYING TO THINK WHO THE THIRD PERSON IS DURING HIS VOYAGE FROM INDIA CHANDRASEKHAR WORKED OUT HOW BIG A STAR COULD BE AND STILL SUPPORT ITSELF AGAINST ITS OWN GRAVITY AFTER IT HAD USED UP ALL ITS FUEL THE IDEA WAS THIS WHEN THE STAR BECOMES SMALL THE MATTER PARTICLES GET VERY NEAR EACH OTHER AND SO ACCORDING TO THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE THEY MUST HAVE VERY DIFFERENT VELOCITIES THIS MAKES THEM MOVE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER AND SO TENDS TO MAKE THE STAR EXPAND A STAR CAN THEREFORE MAINTAIN ITSELF AT A CONSTANT RADIUS BY A BALANCE BETWEEN THE ATTRACTION OF GRAVITY AND THE REPULSION THAT ARISES FROM THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE JUST AS EARLIER IN ITS LIFE CHANDRASEKHAR REALIZED HOWEVER THAT THERE IS A LIMIT TO THE REPULSION THAT THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE CAN PROVIDE THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY LIMITS THE MAXIMUM DIFFERENCE IN THE VELOCITIES OF THE MATTER PARTICLES IN THE STAR TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT THIS MEANS THAT WHEN THE STAR GOT SUFFICIENTLY DENSE THE REPULSION CAUSED BY THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE WOULD BE LESS THAN THE ATTRACTION OF GRAVITY CHANDRASEKHAR CALCULATED THAT A COLD STAR OF MORE THAN ABOUT ONE AND A HALF TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT ITSELF AGAINST ITS OWN GRAVITY THIS MASS IS NOW KNOWN AS THE CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT A SIMILAR DISCOVERY WAS MADE ABOUT THE SAME TIME BY THE RUSSIAN SCIENTIST LEV DAVIDOVICH LANDAU THIS HAD SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ULTIMATE FATE OF MASSIVE STARS IF A STARS MASS IS LESS THAN THE CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT IT CAN EVENTUALLY STOP CONTRACTING AND SETTLE DOWN TO A POSSIBLE FINAL STATE AS A WHITE DWARF WITH A RADIUS OF A FEW THOUSAND MILES AND A DENSITY OF HUNDREDS OF TONS PER CUBIC INCH A WHITE DWARF IS SUPPORTED BY THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE REPULSION BETWEEN THE ELECTRONS IN ITS MATTER WE OBSERVE A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE WHITE DWARF STARS ONE OF THE FIRST TO BE DISCOVERED IS A STAR THAT IS ORBITING AROUND SIRIUS THE BRIGHTEST STAR IN THE NIGHT SKY LANDAU POINTED OUT THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER POSSIBLE FINAL STATE FOR A STAR ALSO WITH A LIMITING MASS OF ABOUT ONE OR TWO TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN BUT MUCH SMALLER EVEN THAN A WHITE DWARF THESE STARS WOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE REPULSION BETWEEN NEUTRONS AND PROTONS RATHER THAN BETWEEN ELECTRONS THEY WERE THEREFORE CALLED NEUTRON STARS THEY WOULD HAVE A RADIUS OF ONLY TEN MILES OR SO AND A DENSITY OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TONS PER CUBIC INCH AT THE TIME THEY WERE FIRST PREDICTED THERE WAS NO WAY THAT NEUTRON STARS COULD BE OBSERVED THEY WERE NOT ACTUALLY DETECTED UNTIL MUCH LATER STARS WITH MASSES ABOVE THE CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WHEN THEY COME TO THE END OF THEIR FUEL IN SOME CASES THEY MAY EXPLODE OR MANAGE TO THROW OFF ENOUGH MATTER TO REDUCE THEIR MASS BELOW THE LIMIT AND SO AVOID CATASTROPHIC GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THIS ALWAYS HAPPENED NO MATTER HOW BIG THE STAR HOW WOULD IT KNOW THAT IT HAD TO LOSE WEIGHT AND EVEN IF EVERY STAR MANAGED TO LOSE ENOUGH MASS TO AVOID COLLAPSE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU ADDED MORE MASS TO A WHITE DWARF OR NEUTRON STAR TO TAKE IT OVER THE LIMIT WOULD IT COLLAPSE TO INFINITE DENSITY EDDINGTON WAS SHOCKED BY THAT IMPLICATION AND HE REFUSED TO BELIEVE CHANDRASEKHARS RESULT EDDINGTON THOUGHT IT WAS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE THAT A STAR COULD COLLAPSE TO A POINT THIS WAS THE VIEW OF MOST SCIENTISTS EINSTEIN HIMSELF WROTE A PAPER IN WHICH HE CLAIMED THAT STARS WOULD NOT SHRINK TO ZERO SIZE THE HOSTILITY OF OTHER SCIENTISTS PARTICULARLY EDDINGTON HIS FORMER TEACHER AND THE LEADING AUTHORITY ON THE STRUCTURE OF STARS PERSUADED CHANDRASEKHAR TO ABANDON THIS LINE OF WORK AND TURN INSTEAD TO OTHER PROBLEMS IN ASTRONOMY SUCH AS THE MOTION OF STAR CLUSTERS HOWEVER WHEN HE WAS AWARDED THE NOBEL PRIZE IN IT WAS AT LEAST IN PART FOR HIS EARLY WORK ON THE LIMITING MASS OF COLD STARS CHANDRASEKHAR HAD SHOWN THAT THE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE COULD NOT HALT THE COLLAPSE OF A STAR MORE MASSIVE THAN THE CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT BUT THE PROBLEM OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO SUCH A STAR ACCORDING TO GENERAL RELATIVITY WAS FIRST SOLVED BY A YOUNG AMERICAN ROBERT OPPENHEIMER IN HIS RESULT HOWEVER SUGGESTED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO OBSERVATIONAL CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD BE DETECTED BY THE TELESCOPES OF THE DAY THEN WORLD WAR II INTERVENED AND OPPENHEIMER HIMSELF BECAME CLOSELY INVOLVED IN THE ATOM BOMB PROJECT AFTER THE WAR THE PROBLEM OF GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE WAS LARGELY FORGOTTEN AS MOST SCIENTISTS BECAME CAUGHT UP IN WHAT HAPPENS ON THE SCALE OF THE ATOM AND ITS NUCLEUS IN THE S HOWEVER INTEREST IN THE LARGESCALE PROBLEMS OF ASTRONOMY AND COSMOLOGY WAS REVIVED BY A GREAT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER AND RANGE OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE APPLICATION OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY OPPENHEIMERS WORK WAS THEN REDISCOVERED AND EXTENDED BY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE PICTURE THAT WE NOW HAVE FROM OPPENHEIMERS WORK IS AS FOLLOWS THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD OF THE STAR CHANGES THE PATHS OF LIGHT RAYS IN SPACETIME FROM WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THE STAR NOT BEEN PRESENT THE LIGHT CONES WHICH INDICATE THE PATHS FOLLOWED IN SPACE AND TIME BY FLASHES OF LIGHT EMITTED FROM THEIR TIPS ARE BENT SLIGHTLY INWARD NEAR THE SURFACE OF THE STAR THIS CAN BE SEEN IN THE BENDING OF LIGHT FROM DISTANT STARS OBSERVED DURING AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN AS THE STAR CONTRACTS THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD AT ITS SURFACE GETS STRONGER AND THE LIGHT CONES GET BENT INWARD MORE THIS MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR LIGHT FROM THE STAR TO ESCAPE AND THE LIGHT APPEARS DIMMER AND REDDER TO AN OBSERVER AT A DISTANCE EVENTUALLY WHEN THE STAR HAS SHRUNK TO A CERTAIN CRITICAL RADIUS THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD AT THE SURFACE BECOMES SO STRONG THAT THE LIGHT CONES ARE BENT INWARD SO MUCH THAT LIGHT CAN NO LONGER ESCAPE ACCORDING TO THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY NOTHING CAN TRAVEL FASTER THAN LIGHT THUS IF LIGHT CANNOT ESCAPE NEITHER CAN ANYTHING ELSE EVERYTHING IS DRAGGED BACK BY THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD SO ONE HAS A SET OF EVENTS A REGION OF SPACETIME FROM WHICH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESCAPE TO REACH A DISTANT OBSERVER THIS REGION IS WHAT WE NOW CALL A BLACK HOLE ITS BOUNDARY IS CALLED THE EVENT HORIZON AND IT COINCIDES WITH THE PATHS OF LIGHT RAYS THAT JUST FAIL TO ESCAPE FROM THE BLACK HOLE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IF YOU WERE WATCHING A STAR COLLAPSE TO FORM A BLACK HOLE ONE HAS TO REMEMBER THAT IN THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE TIME EACH OBSERVER HAS HIS OWN MEASURE OF TIME THE TIME FOR SOMEONE ON A STAR WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT FOR SOMEONE AT A DISTANCE BECAUSE OF THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD OF THE STAR SUPPOSE AN INTREPID ASTRONAUT ON THE SURFACE OF THE COLLAPSING STAR COLLAPSING INWARD WITH IT SENT A SIGNAL EVERY SECOND ACCORDING TO HIS WATCH TO HIS SPACESHIP ORBITING ABOUT THE STAR AT SOME TIME ON HIS WATCH SAY THE STAR WOULD SHRINK BELOW THE CRITICAL RADIUS AT WHICH THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD BECOMES SO STRONG NOTHING CAN ESCAPE AND HIS SIGNALS WOULD NO LONGER REACH THE SPACESHIP AS APPROACHED HIS COMPANIONS WATCHING FROM THE SPACESHIP WOULD FIND THE INTERVALS BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE SIGNALS FROM THE ASTRONAUT GETTING LONGER AND LONGER BUT THIS EFFECT WOULD BE VERY SMALL BEFORE THEY WOULD HAVE TO WAIT ONLY VERY SLIGHTLY MORE THAN A SECOND BETWEEN THE ASTRONAUTS  SIGNAL AND THE ONE THAT HE SENT WHEN HIS WATCH READ BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOREVER FOR THE SIGNAL THE LIGHT WAVES EMITTED FROM THE SURFACE OF THE STAR BETWEEN AND BY THE ASTRONAUTS WATCH WOULD BE SPREAD OUT OVER AN INFINITE PERIOD OF TIME AS SEEN FROM THE SPACESHIP THE TIME INTERVAL BETWEEN THE ARRIVAL OF SUCCESSIVE WAVES AT THE SPACESHIP WOULD GET LONGER AND LONGER SO THE LIGHT FROM THE STAR WOULD APPEAR REDDER AND REDDER AND FAINTER AND FAINTER EVENTUALLY THE STAR WOULD BE SO DIM THAT IT COULD NO LONGER BE SEEN FROM THE SPACESHIP ALL THAT WOULD BE LEFT WOULD BE A BLACK HOLE IN SPACE THE STAR WOULD HOWEVER CONTINUE TO EXERT THE SAME GRAVITATIONAL FORCE ON THE SPACESHIP WHICH WOULD CONTINUE TO ORBIT THE BLACK HOLE THIS SCENARIO IS NOT ENTIRELY REALISTIC HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEM GRAVITY GETS WEAKER THE FARTHER YOU ARE FROM THE STAR SO THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE ON OUR INTREPID ASTRONAUTS FEET WOULD ALWAYS BE GREATER THAN THE FORCE ON HIS HEAD THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE FORCES WOULD STRETCH OUR ASTRONAUT OUT LIKE SPAGHETTI OR TEAR HIM APART BEFORE THE STAR HAD CONTRACTED TO THE CRITICAL RADIUS AT WHICH THE EVENT HORIZON FORMED HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MUCH LARGER OBJECTS IN THE UNIVERSE LIKE THE CENTRAL REGIONS OF GALAXIES THAT CAN ALSO UNDERGO GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE TO PRODUCE BLACK HOLES AN ASTRONAUT ON ONE OF THESE WOULD NOT BE TORN APART BEFORE THE BLACK HOLE FORMED HE WOULD NOT IN FACT FEEL ANYTHING SPECIAL AS HE REACHED THE CRITICAL RADIUS AND COULD PASS THE POINT OF NO RETURN WITHOUT NOTICING IT HOWEVER WITHIN JUST A FEW HOURS AS THE REGION CONTINUED TO COLLAPSE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCES ON HIS HEAD AND HIS FEET WOULD BECOME SO STRONG THAT AGAIN IT WOULD TEAR HIM APART THE WORK THAT ROGER PENROSE AND I DID BETWEEN AND SHOWED THAT ACCORDING TO GENERAL RELATIVITY THERE MUST BE A SINGULARITY OF INFINITE DENSITY AND SPACETIME CURVATURE WITHIN A BLACK HOLE THIS IS RATHER LIKE THE BIG BANG AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME ONLY IT WOULD BE AN END OF TIME FOR THE COLLAPSING BODY AND THE ASTRONAUT AT THIS SINGULARITY THE LAWS OF SCIENCE AND OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT THE FUTURE WOULD BREAK DOWN HOWEVER ANY OBSERVER WHO REMAINED OUTSIDE THE BLACK HOLE WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS FAILURE OF PREDICTABILITY BECAUSE NEITHER LIGHT NOR ANY OTHER SIGNAL COULD REACH HIM FROM THE SINGULARITY THIS REMARKABLE FACT LED ROGER PENROSE TO PROPOSE THE COSMIC CENSORSHIP HYPOTHESIS WHICH MIGHT BE PARAPHRASED AS GOD ABHORS A NAKED SINGULARITY IN OTHER WORDS THE SINGULARITIES PRODUCED BY GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OCCUR ONLY IN PLACES LIKE BLACK HOLES WHERE THEY ARE DECENTLY HIDDEN FROM OUTSIDE VIEW BY AN EVENT HORIZON STRICTLY THIS IS WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE WEAK COSMIC CENSORSHIP HYPOTHESIS IT PROTECTS OBSERVERS WHO REMAIN OUTSIDE THE BLACK HOLE FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BREAKDOWN OF PREDICTABILITY THAT OCCURS AT THE SINGULARITY BUT IT DOES NOTHING AT ALL FOR THE POOR UNFORTUNATE ASTRONAUT WHO FALLS INTO THE HOLE THERE ARE SOME SOLUTIONS OF THE EQUATIONS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY IN WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE FOR OUR ASTRONAUT TO SEE A NAKED SINGULARITY HE MAY BE ABLE TO AVOID HITTING THE SINGULARITY AND INSTEAD FALL THROUGH A WORMHOLE AND COME OUT IN ANOTHER REGION OF THE UNIVERSE THIS WOULD OFFER GREAT POSSIBILITIES FOR TRAVEL IN SPACE AND TIME BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT SEEMS THAT THESE SOLUTIONS MAY ALL BE HIGHLY UNSTABLE THE LEAST DISTURBANCE SUCH AS THE PRESENCE OF AN ASTRONAUT MAY CHANGE THEM SO THAT THE ASTRONAUT COULD NOT SEE THE SINGULARITY UNTIL HE HIT IT AND HIS TIME CAME TO AN END IN OTHER WORDS THE SINGULARITY WOULD ALWAYS LIE IN HIS FUTURE AND NEVER IN HIS PAST THE STRONG VERSION OF THE COSMIC CENSORSHIP HYPOTHESIS STATES THAT IN A REALISTIC SOLUTION THE SINGULARITIES WOULD ALWAYS LIE EITHER ENTIRELY IN THE FUTURE LIKE THE SINGULARITIES OF GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OR ENTIRELY IN THE PAST LIKE THE BIG BANG I STRONGLY BELIEVE IN COSMIC CENSORSHIP SO I BET KIP THORNE AND JOHN PRESKILL OF CAL TECH THAT IT WOULD ALWAYS HOLD I LOST THE BET ON A TECHNICALITY BECAUSE EXAMPLES WERE PRODUCED OF SOLUTIONS WITH A SINGULARITY THAT WAS VISIBLE FROM A LONG WAY AWAY SO I HAD TO PAY UP WHICH ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE BET MEANT I HAD TO CLOTHE THEIR NAKEDNESS BUT I CAN CLAIM A MORAL VICTORY THE NAKED SINGULARITIES WERE UNSTABLE THE LEAST DISTURBANCE WOULD CAUSE THEM EITHER TO DISAPPEAR OR TO BE HIDDEN BEHIND AN EVENT HORIZON SO THEY WOULD NOT OCCUR IN REALISTIC SITUATIONS THE EVENT HORIZON THE BOUNDARY OF THE REGION OF SPACETIME FROM WHICH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESCAPE ACTS RATHER LIKE A ONEWAY MEMBRANE AROUND THE BLACK HOLE OBJECTS SUCH AS UNWARY ASTRONAUTS CAN FALL THROUGH THE EVENT HORIZON INTO THE BLACK HOLE BUT NOTHING CAN EVER GET OUT OF THE BLACK HOLE THROUGH THE EVENT HORIZON REMEMBER THAT THE EVENT HORIZON IS THE PATH IN SPACETIME OF LIGHT THAT IS TRYING TO ESCAPE FROM THE BLACK HOLE AND NOTHING CAN TRAVEL FASTER THAN LIGHT ONE COULD WELL SAY OF THE EVENT HORIZON WHAT THE POET DANTE SAID OF THE ENTRANCE TO HELL ALL HOPE ABANDON YE WHO ENTER HERE ANYTHING OR ANYONE WHO FALLS THROUGH THE EVENT HORIZON WILL SOON REACH THE REGION OF INFINITE DENSITY AND THE END OF TIME GENERAL RELATIVITY PREDICTS THAT HEAVY OBJECTS THAT ARE MOVING WILL CAUSE THE EMISSION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES RIPPLES IN THE CURVATURE OF SPACE THAT TRAVEL AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT THESE ARE SIMILAR TO LIGHT WAVES WHICH ARE RIPPLES OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD BUT THEY ARE MUCH HARDER TO DETECT THEY CAN BE OBSERVED BY THE VERY SLIGHT CHANGE IN SEPARATION THEY PRODUCE BETWEEN NEIGHBORING FREELY MOVING OBJECTS A NUMBER OF DETECTORS ARE BEING BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES EUROPE AND JAPAN THAT WILL MEASURE DISPLACEMENTS OF ONE PART IN A THOUSAND MILLION MILLION MILLION WITH TWENTYONE ZEROS AFTER IT OR LESS THAN THE NUCLEUS OF AN ATOM OVER A DISTANCE OF TEN MILES LIKE LIGHT GRAVITATIONAL WAVES CARRY ENERGY AWAY FROM THE OBJECTS THAT EMIT THEM ONE WOULD THEREFORE EXPECT A SYSTEM OF MASSIVE OBJECTS TO SETTLE DOWN EVENTUALLY TO A STATIONARY STATE BECAUSE THE ENERGY IN ANY MOVEMENT WOULD BE CARRIED AWAY BY THE EMISSION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES IT IS RATHER LIKE DROPPING A CORK INTO WATER AT FIRST IT BOBS UP AND DOWN A GREAT DEAL BUT AS THE RIPPLES CARRY AWAY ITS ENERGY IT EVENTUALLY SETTLES DOWN TO A STATIONARY STATE FOR EXAMPLE THE MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH IN ITS ORBIT ROUND THE SUN PRODUCES GRAVITATIONAL WAVES THE EFFECT OF THE ENERGY LOSS WILL BE TO CHANGE THE ORBIT OF THE EARTH SO THAT GRADUALLY IT GETS NEARER AND NEARER TO THE SUN EVENTUALLY COLLIDES WITH IT AND SETTLES DOWN TO A STATIONARY STATE THE RATE OF ENERGY LOSS IN THE CASE OF THE EARTH AND THE SUN IS VERY LOW ABOUT ENOUGH TO RUN A SMALL ELECTRIC HEATER THIS MEANS IT WILL TAKE ABOUT A THOUSAND MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION YEARS FOR THE EARTH TO RUN INTO THE SUN SO THERES NO IMMEDIATE CAUSE FOR WORRY THE CHANGE IN THE ORBIT OF THE EARTH IS TOO SLOW TO BE OBSERVED BUT THIS SAME EFFECT HAS BEEN OBSERVED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS OCCURRING IN THE SYSTEM CALLED PSR   PSR STANDS FOR PULSAR A SPECIAL TYPE OF NEUTRON STAR THAT EMITS REGULAR PULSES OF RADIO WAVES THIS SYSTEM CONTAINS TWO NEUTRON STARS ORBITING EACH OTHER AND THE ENERGY THEY ARE LOSING BY THE EMISSION OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES IS CAUSING THEM TO SPIRAL IN TOWARD EACH OTHER THIS CONFIRMATION OF GENERAL RELATIVITY WON J H TAYLOR AND R A HULSE THE NOBEL PRIZE IN IT WILL TAKE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS FOR THEM TO COLLIDE JUST BEFORE THEY DO THEY WILL BE ORBITING SO FAST THAT THEY WILL EMIT ENOUGH GRAVITATIONAL WAVES FOR DETECTORS LIKE LIGO TO PICK UP DURING THE GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OF A STAR TO FORM A BLACK HOLE THE MOVEMENTS WOULD BE MUCH MORE RAPID SO THE RATE AT WHICH ENERGY IS CARRIED AWAY WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER IT WOULD THEREFORE NOT BE TOO LONG BEFORE IT SETTLED DOWN TO A STATIONARY STATE WHAT WOULD THIS FINAL STAGE LOOK LIKE ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT IT WOULD DEPEND ON ALL THE COMPLEX FEATURES OF THE STAR FROM WHICH IT HAD FORMED NOT ONLY ITS MASS AND RATE OF ROTATION BUT ALSO THE DIFFERENT DENSITIES OF VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STAR AND THE COMPLICATED MOVEMENTS OF THE GASES WITHIN THE STAR AND IF BLACK HOLES WERE AS VARIED AS THE OBJECTS THAT COLLAPSED TO FORM THEM IT MIGHT BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE ANY PREDICTIONS ABOUT BLACK HOLES IN GENERAL IN HOWEVER THE STUDY OF BLACK HOLES WAS REVOLUTIONIZED BY WERNER ISRAEL A CANADIAN SCIENTIST WHO WAS BORN IN BERLIN BROUGHT UP IN SOUTH AFRICA AND TOOK HIS DOCTORAL DEGREE IN IRELAND ISRAEL SHOWED THAT ACCORDING TO GENERAL RELATIVITY NONROTATING BLACK HOLES MUST BE VERY SIMPLE THEY WERE PERFECTLY SPHERICAL THEIR SIZE DEPENDED ONLY ON THEIR MASS AND ANY TWO SUCH BLACK HOLES WITH THE SAME MASS WERE IDENTICAL THEY COULD IN FACT BE DESCRIBED BY A PARTICULAR SOLUTION OF EINSTEINS EQUATIONS THAT HAD BEEN KNOWN SINCE FOUND BY KARL SCHWARZSCHILD SHORTLY AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF GENERAL RELATIVITY AT FIRST MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING ISRAEL HIMSELF ARGUED THAT SINCE BLACK HOLES HAD TO BE PERFECTLY SPHERICAL A BLACK HOLE COULD ONLY FORM FROM THE COLLAPSE OF A PERFECTLY SPHERICAL OBJECT ANY REAL STAR WHICH WOULD NEVER BE PERFECTLY SPHERICAL COULD THEREFORE ONLY COLLAPSE TO FORM A NAKED SINGULARITY THERE WAS HOWEVER A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF ISRAELS RESULT WHICH WAS ADVOCATED BY ROGER PENROSE AND JOHN WHEELER IN PARTICULAR THEY ARGUED THAT THE RAPID MOVEMENTS INVOLVED IN A STARS COLLAPSE WOULD MEAN THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES IT GAVE OFF WOULD MAKE IT EVER MORE SPHERICAL AND BY THE TIME IT HAD SETTLED DOWN TO A STATIONARY STATE IT WOULD BE PRECISELY SPHERICAL ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW ANY NONROTATING STAR HOWEVER COMPLICATED ITS SHAPE AND INTERNAL STRUCTURE WOULD END UP AFTER GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE AS A PERFECTLY SPHERICAL BLACK HOLE WHOSE SIZE WOULD DEPEND ONLY ON ITS MASS FURTHER CALCULATIONS SUPPORTED THIS VIEW AND IT SOON CAME TO BE ADOPTED GENERALLY ISRAELS RESULT DEALT WITH THE CASE OF BLACK HOLES FORMED FROM NONROTATING BODIES ONLY IN ROY KERR A NEW ZEALANDER FOUND A SET OF SOLUTIONS OF THE EQUATIONS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY THAT DESCRIBED ROTATING BLACK HOLES THESE KERR BLACK HOLES ROTATE AT A CONSTANT RATE THEIR SIZE AND SHAPE DEPENDING ONLY ON THEIR MASS AND RATE OF ROTATION IF THE ROTATION IS ZERO THE BLACK HOLE IS PERFECTLY ROUND AND THE SOLUTION IS IDENTICAL TO THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION IF THE ROTATION IS NONZERO THE BLACK HOLE BULGES OUTWARD NEAR ITS EQUATOR JUST AS THE EARTH OR THE SUN BULGE DUE TO THEIR ROTATION AND THE FASTER IT ROTATES THE MORE IT BULGES SO TO EXTEND ISRAELS RESULT TO INCLUDE ROTATING BODIES IT WAS CONJECTURED THAT ANY ROTATING BODY THAT COLLAPSED TO FORM A BLACK HOLE WOULD EVENTUALLY SETTLE DOWN TO A STATIONARY STATE DESCRIBED BY THE KERR SOLUTION IN A COLLEAGUE AND FELLOW RESEARCH STUDENT OF MINE AT CAMBRIDGE BRANDON CARTER TOOK THE FIRST STEP TOWARD PROVING THIS CONJECTURE HE SHOWED THAT PROVIDED A STATIONARY ROTATING BLACK HOLE HAD AN AXIS OF SYMMETRY LIKE A SPINNING TOP ITS SIZE AND SHAPE WOULD DEPEND ONLY ON ITS MASS AND RATE OF ROTATION THEN IN I PROVED THAT ANY STATIONARY ROTATING BLACK HOLE WOULD INDEED HAVE SUCH AN AXIS OF SYMMETRY FINALLY IN DAVID ROBINSON AT KINGS COLLEGE LONDON USED CARTERS AND MY RESULTS TO SHOW THAT THE CONJECTURE HAD BEEN CORRECT SUCH A BLACK HOLE HAD INDEED TO BE THE KERR SOLUTION SO AFTER GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE A BLACK HOLE MUST SETTLE DOWN INTO A STATE IN WHICH IT COULD BE ROTATING BUT NOT PULSATING MOREOVER ITS SIZE AND SHAPE WOULD DEPEND ONLY ON ITS MASS AND RATE OF ROTATION AND NOT ON THE NATURE OF THE BODY THAT HAD COLLAPSED TO FORM IT THIS RESULT BECAME KNOWN BY THE MAXIM A BLACK HOLE HAS NO HAIR THE NO HAIR THEOREM IS OF GREAT PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE BECAUSE IT SO GREATLY RESTRICTS THE POSSIBLE TYPES OF BLACK HOLES ONE CAN THEREFORE MAKE DETAILED MODELS OF OBJECTS THAT MIGHT CONTAIN BLACK HOLES AND COMPARE THE PREDICTIONS OF THE MODELS WITH OBSERVATIONS IT ALSO MEANS THAT A VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE BODY THAT HAS COLLAPSED MUST BE LOST WHEN A BLACK HOLE IS FORMED BECAUSE AFTERWARD ALL WE CAN POSSIBLY MEASURE ABOUT THE BODY IS ITS MASS AND RATE OF ROTATION THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS WILL BE SEEN IN THE NEXT CHAPTER BLACK HOLES ARE ONE OF ONLY A FAIRLY SMALL NUMBER OF CASES IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE IN WHICH A THEORY WAS DEVELOPED IN GREAT DETAIL AS A MATHEMATICAL MODEL BEFORE THERE WAS ANY EVIDENCE FROM OBSERVATIONS THAT IT WAS CORRECT INDEED THIS USED TO BE THE MAIN ARGUMENT OF OPPONENTS OF BLACK HOLES HOW COULD ONE BELIEVE IN OBJECTS FOR WHICH THE ONLY EVIDENCE WAS CALCULATIONS BASED ON THE DUBIOUS THEORY OF GENERAL RELATIVITY IN HOWEVER MAARTEN SCHMIDT AN ASTRONOMER AT THE PALOMAR OBSERVATORY IN CALIFORNIA MEASURED THE RED SHIFT OF A FAINT STARLIKE OBJECT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SOURCE OF RADIO WAVES CALLED C THAT IS SOURCE NUMBER IN THE THIRD CAMBRIDGE CATALOGUE OF RADIO SOURCES HE FOUND IT WAS TOO LARGE TO BE CAUSED BY A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD IF IT HAD BEEN A GRAVITATIONAL RED SHIFT THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE TO BE SO MASSIVE AND SO NEAR TO US THAT IT WOULD DISTURB THE ORBITS OF PLANETS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM THIS SUGGESTED THAT THE RED SHIFT WAS INSTEAD CAUSED BY THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE WHICH IN TURN MEANT THAT THE OBJECT WAS A VERY LONG DISTANCE AWAY AND TO BE VISIBLE AT SUCH A GREAT DISTANCE THE OBJECT MUST BE VERY BRIGHT MUST IN OTHER WORDS BE EMITTING A HUGE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THE ONLY MECHANISM THAT PEOPLE COULD THINK OF THAT WOULD PRODUCE SUCH LARGE QUANTITIES OF ENERGY SEEMED TO BE THE GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE NOT JUST OF A STAR BUT OF A WHOLE CENTRAL REGION OF A GALAXY A NUMBER OF OTHER SIMILAR QUASISTELLAR OBJECTS OR QUASARS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED ALL WITH LARGE RED SHIFTS BUT THEY ARE ALL TOO FAR AWAY AND THEREFORE TOO DIFFICULT TO OBSERVE TO PROVIDE CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF BLACK HOLES FURTHER ENCOURAGEMENT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF BLACK HOLES CAME IN WITH THE DISCOVERY BY A RESEARCH STUDENT AT CAMBRIDGE JOCELYN BELLBURNELL OF OBJECTS IN THE SKY THAT WERE EMITTING REGULAR PULSES OF RADIO WAVES AT FIRST BELL AND HER SUPERVISOR ANTONY HEWISH THOUGHT THEY MIGHT HAVE MADE CONTACT WITH AN ALIEN CIVILIZATION IN THE GALAXY INDEED AT THE SEMINAR AT WHICH THEY ANNOUNCED THEIR DISCOVERY I REMEMBER THAT THEY CALLED THE FIRST FOUR SOURCES TO BE FOUND LGM LGM STANDING FOR LITTLE GREEN MEN IN THE END HOWEVER THEY AND EVERYONE ELSE CAME TO THE LESS ROMANTIC CONCLUSION THAT THESE OBJECTS WHICH WERE GIVEN THE NAME PULSARS WERE IN FACT ROTATING NEUTRON STARS THAT WERE EMITTING PULSES OF RADIO WAVES BECAUSE OF A COMPLICATED INTERACTION BETWEEN THEIR MAGNETIC FIELDS AND SURROUNDING MATTER THIS WAS BAD NEWS FOR WRITERS OF SPACE WESTERNS BUT VERY HOPEFUL FOR THE SMALL NUMBER OF US WHO BELIEVED IN BLACK HOLES AT THAT TIME IT WAS THE FIRST POSITIVE EVIDENCE THAT NEUTRON STARS EXISTED A NEUTRON STAR HAS A RADIUS OF ABOUT TEN MILES ONLY A FEW TIMES THE CRITICAL RADIUS AT WHICH A STAR BECOMES A BLACK HOLE IF A STAR COULD COLLAPSE TO SUCH A SMALL SIZE IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT OTHER STARS COULD COLLAPSE TO EVEN SMALLER SIZE AND BECOME BLACK HOLES HOW COULD WE HOPE TO DETECT A BLACK HOLE AS BY ITS VERY DEFINITION IT DOES NOT EMIT ANY LIGHT IT MIGHT SEEM A BIT LIKE LOOKING FOR A BLACK CAT IN A COAL CELLAR FORTUNATELY THERE IS A WAY AS JOHN MICHELL POINTED OUT IN HIS PIONEERING PAPER IN  A BLACK HOLE STILL EXERTS A GRAVITATIONAL FIERCE ON NEARBY OBJECTS ASTRONOMERS HAVE OBSERVED MANY SYSTEMS IN WHICH TWO STARS ORBIT AROUND EACH OTHER ATTRACTED TOWARD EACH OTHER BY GRAVITY THEY ALSO OBSERVE SYSTEMS IN WHICH THERE IS ONLY ONE VISIBLE STAR THAT IS ORBITING AROUND SOME UNSEEN COMPANION ONE CANNOT OF COURSE IMMEDIATELY CONCLUDE THAT THE COMPANION IS A BLACK HOLE IT MIGHT MERELY BE A STAR THAT IS TOO FAINT TO BE SEEN HOWEVER SOME OF THESE SYSTEMS LIKE THE ONE CALLED CYGNUS X ARE ALSO STRONG SOURCES OF XRAYS THE BEST EXPLANATION FOR THIS PHENOMENON IS THAT MATTER HAS BEEN BLOWN OFF THE SURFACE OF THE VISIBLE STAR AS IT FALLS TOWARD THE UNSEEN COMPANION IT DEVELOPS A SPIRAL MOTION RATHER LIKE WATER RUNNING OUT OF A BATH AND IT GETS VERY HOT EMITTING XRAYS FOR THIS MECHANISM TO WORK THE UNSEEN OBJECT HAS TO BE VERY SMALL LIKE A WHITE DWARF NEUTRON STAR OR BLACK HOLE FROM THE OBSERVED ORBIT OF THE VISIBLE STAR ONE CAN DETERMINE THE LOWEST POSSIBLE MASS OF THE UNSEEN OBJECT IN THE CASE OF CYGNUS XL THIS IS ABOUT SIX TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN WHICH ACCORDING TO CHANDRASEKHARR RESULT IS TOO GREAT FOR THE UNSEEN OBJECT TO BE A WHITE DWARF IT IS ALSO TOO LARGE A MASS TO BE A NEUTRON STAR IT SEEMS THEREFORE THAT IT MUST BE A BLACK HOLE THERE ARE OTHER MODELS TO EXPLAIN CYGNUS X THAT DO NOT INCLUDE A BLACK HOLE BUT THEY ARE ALL RATHER FARFETCHED A BLACK HOLE SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY REALLY NATURAL EXPLANATION OF THE OBSERVATIONS DESPITE THIS I HAD A BET WITH KIP THORNE OF THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT IN FACT CYGNUS X DOES NOT CONTAIN A BLACK HOLE THIS WAS A FORM F INSURANCE POLICY FOR ME I HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON BLACK HOLES AND IT WOULD ALL BE WASTED IF IT TURNED OUT THAT BLACK HOLES DO NOT EXIST BUT IN THAT CASE I WOULD HAVE THE CONSOLATION OF WINNING MY BET WHICH WOULD BRING ME FOUR YEARS OF THE MAGAZINE PRIVATE EYE IN FACT ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION WITH CYGNUS X HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH SINCE WE MADE THE BET IN THERE IS NOW SO MUCH OTHER OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF BLACK HOLES THAT I HAVE CONCEDED THE BET I PAID THE SPECIFIED PENALTY WHICH WAS A ONEYEAR SUBSCRIPTION TO PENTHOUSE TO THE OUTRAGE OF KIPS LIBERATED WIFE WE ALSO NOW HAVE EVIDENCE FOR SEVERAL OTHER BLACK HOLES IN SYSTEMS LIKE CYGNUS X IN OUR GALAXY AND IN TWO NEIGHBORING GALAXIES CALLED THE MAGELLANIC CLOUDS THE NUMBER OF BLACK HOLES HOWEVER IS ALMOST CERTAINLY VERY MUCH HIGHER IN THE LONG HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE MANY STARS MUST HAVE BURNED ALL THEIR NUCLEAR FUEL AND HAVE HAD TO COLLAPSE THE NUMBER OF BLACK HOLES MAY WELL BE GREATER EVEN THAN THE NUMBER OF VISIBLE STARS WHICH TOTALS ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND MILLION IN OUR GALAXY ALONE THE EXTRA GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION OF SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF BLACK HOLES COULD EXPLAIN WHY OUR GALAXY ROTATES AT THE RATE IT DOES THE MASS OF THE VISIBLE STARS IS INSUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS WE ALSO HAVE SOME EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS A MUCH LARGER BLACK HOLE WITH A MASS OF ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES THAT OF THE SUN AT THE CENTER OF OUR GALAXY STARS IN THE GALAXY THAT COME TOO NEAR THIS BLACK HOLE WILL BE TORN APART BY THE DIFFERENCE IN THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCES ON THEIR NEAR AND FAR SIDES THEIR REMAINS AND GAS THAT IS THROWN OFF OTHER STARS WILL FALL TOWARD THE BLACK HOLE AS IN THE CASE OF CYGNUS XL THE GAS WILL SPIRAL INWARD AND WILL HEAT UP THOUGH NOT AS MUCH AS IN THAT CASE IT WILL NOT GET HOT ENOUGH TO EMIT X RAYS BUT IT COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE VERY COMPACT SOURCE OF RADIO WAVES AND INFRARED RAYS THAT IS OBSERVED AT THE GALACTIC CENTER IT IS THOUGHT THAT SIMILAR BUT EVEN LARGER BLACK HOLES WITH MASSES OF ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN OCCUR AT THE CENTERS OF QUASARS FOR EXAMPLE OBSERVATIONS WITH THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE OF THE GALAXY KNOWN AS M  REVEAL THAT IT CONTAINS A DISK OF GAS LIGHTYEARS ACROSS ROTATING ABOUT A CENTRAL OBJECT TWO THOUSAND MILLION TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN THIS CAN ONLY BE A BLACK HOLE MATTER FALLING INTO SUCH A SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE WOULD PROVIDE THE ONLY SOURCE OF POWER GREAT ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN THE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF ENERGY THAT THESE OBJECTS ARE EMITTING AS THE MATTER SPIRALS INTO THE BLACK HOLE IT WOULD MAKE THE BLACK HOLE ROTATE IN THE SAME DIRECTION CAUSING IT TO DEVELOP A MAGNETIC FIELD RATHER LIKE THAT OF THE EARTH VERY HIGHENERGY PARTICLES WOULD BE GENERATED NEAR THE BLACK HOLE BY THE INFALLING MATTER THE MAGNETIC FIELD WOULD BE SO STRONG THAT IT COULD FOCUS THESE PARTICLES INTO JETS EJECTED OUTWARD ALONG THE AXIS OF ROTATION OF THE BLACK HOLE THAT IS IN THE DIRECTIONS OF ITS NORTH AND SOUTH POLES SUCH JETS ARE INDEED OBSERVED IN A NUMBER OF GALAXIES AND QUASARS ONE CAN ALSO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MIGHT BE BLACK HOLES WITH MASSES MUCH LESS THAN THAT OF THE SUN SUCH BLACK HOLES COULD NOT BE FORMED BY GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEIR MASSES ARE BELOW THE CHANDRASEKHAR MASS LIMIT STARS OF THIS LOW MASS CAN SUPPORT THEMSELVES AGAINST THE FORCE OF GRAVITY EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR NUCLEAR FUEL LEINSTEINS GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ON ITS OWN PREDICTED THAT SPACETIME BEGAN AT THE BIG BANG SINGULARITY AND WOULD COME TO AN END EITHER AT THE BIG CRUNCH SINGULARITY IF THE WHOLE UNIVERSE RECOLLAPSED OR AT A SINGULARITY INSIDE A BLACK HOLE IF A LOCAL REGION SUCH AS A STAR WERE TO COLLAPSE ANY MATTER THAT FELL INTO THE HOLE WOULD BE DESTROYED AT THE SINGULARITY AND ONLY THE GRAVITATIONAL EFFECT OF ITS MASS WOULD CONTINUE TO BE FELT OUTSIDE ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN QUANTUM EFFECTS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IT SEEMED THAT THE MASS OR ENERGY OF THE MATTER WOULD EVENTUALLY BE RETURNED TO THE REST OF THE UNIVERSE AND THAT THE BLACK HOLE ALONG WITH ANY SINGULARITY INSIDE IT WOULD EVAPORATE AWAY AND FINALLY DISAPPEAR COULD QUANTUM MECHANICS HAVE AN EQUALLY DRAMATIC EFFECT ON THE BIG BANG AND BIG CRUNCH SINGULARITIES WHAT REALLY HAPPENS DURING THE VERY EARLY OR LATE STAGES OF THE UNIVERSE WHEN GRAVITATIONAL FIELDS ARE SO STRONG THAT QUANTUM EFFECTS CANNOT BE IGNORED DOES THE UNIVERSE IN FACT HAVE A BEGINNING OR AN END AND IF SO WHAT ARE THEY LIKE THROUGHOUT THE S I HAD BEEN MAINLY STUDYING BLACK HOLES BUT IN MY INTEREST IN QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ORIGIN AND FATE OF THE UNIVERSE WAS REAWAKENED WHEN I ATTENDED A CONFERENCE ON COSMOLOGY ORGANIZED BY THE JESUITS IN THE VATICAN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAD MADE A BAD MISTAKE WITH GALILEO WHEN IT TRIED TO LAY DOWN THE LAW ON A QUESTION OF SCIENCE DECLARING THAT THE SUN WENT ROUND THE EARTH NOW CENTURIES LATER IT HAD DECIDED TO INVITE A NUMBER OF EXPERTS TO ADVISE IT ON COSMOLOGY AT THE END OF THE CONFERENCE THE PARTICIPANTS WERE GRANTED AN AUDIENCE WITH THE POPE HE TOLD US THAT IT WAS ALL RIGHT TO STUDY THE EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE AFTER THE BIG BANG BUT WE SHOULD NOT INQUIRE INTO THE BIG BANG ITSELF BECAUSE THAT WAS THE MOMENT OF CREATION AND THEREFORE THE WORK OF GOD I WAS GLAD THEN THAT HE DID NOT KNOW THE SUBJECT OF THE TALK I HAD JUST GIVEN AT THE CONFERENCE THE POSSIBILITY THAT SPACETIME WAS FINITE BUT HAD NO BOUNDARY WHICH MEANS THAT IT HAD NO BEGINNING NO MOMENT OF CREATION I HAD NO DESIRE TO SHARE THE FATE OF GALILEO WITH WHOM I FEEL A STRONG SENSE OF IDENTITY PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE COINCIDENCE OF HAVING BEEN BORN EXACTLY YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN THE IDEAS THAT I AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD ABOUT HOW QUANTUM MECHANICS MAY AFFECT THE ORIGIN AND FATE OF THE UNIVERSE IT IS NECESSARY FIRST TO UNDERSTAND THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE ACCORDING TO WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE HOT BIG BANG MODEL THIS ASSUMES THAT THE UNIVERSE IS DESCRIBED BY A FRIEDMANN MODEL RIGHT BACK TO THE BIG BANG IN SUCH MODELS ONE FINDS THAT AS THE UNIVERSE EXPANDS ANY MATTER OR RADIATION IN IT GETS COOLER WHEN THE UNIVERSE DOUBLES IN SIZE ITS TEMPERATURE FALLS BY HALF SINCE TEMPERATURE IS SIMPLY A MEASURE OF THE AVERAGE ENERGY OR SPEED OF THE PARTICLES THIS COOLING OF THE UNIVERSE WOULD HAVE A MAJOR EFFECT ON THE MATTER IN IT AT VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES PARTICLES WOULD BE MOVING AROUND SO FAST THAT THEY COULD ESCAPE ANY ATTRACTION TOWARD EACH OTHER DUE TO NUCLEAR OR ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCES BUT AS THEY COOLED OFF ONE WOULD EXPECT PARTICLES THAT ATTRACT EACH OTHER TO START TO CLUMP TOGETHER MOREOVER EVEN THE TYPES OF PARTICLES THAT EXIST IN THE UNIVERSE WOULD DEPEND ON THE TEMPERATURE AT HIGH ENOUGH TEMPERATURES PARTICLES HAVE SO MUCH ENERGY THAT WHENEVER THEY COLLIDE MANY DIFFERENT PARTICLEANTIPARTICLE PAIRS WOULD BE PRODUCED AND ALTHOUGH SOME OF THESE PARTICLES WOULD ANNIHILATE ON HITTING ANTIPARTICLES THEY WOULD BE PRODUCED MORE RAPIDLY THAN THEY COULD ANNIHILATE AT LOWER TEMPERATURES HOWEVER WHEN COLLIDING PARTICLES HAVE LESS ENERGY PARTICLEANTIPARTICLE PAIRS WOULD BE PRODUCED LESS QUICKLY AND ANNIHILATION WOULD BECOME FASTER THAN PRODUCTION AT THE BIG BANG ITSELF THE UNIVERSE IS THOUGHT TO HAVE HAD ZERO SIZE AND SO TO HAVE BEEN INFINITELY HOT BUT AS THE UNIVERSE EXPANDED THE TEMPERATURE OF THE RADIATION DECREASED ONE SECOND AFTER THE BIG BANG IT WOULD HAVE FALLEN TO ABOUT TEN THOUSAND MILLION DEGREES THIS IS ABOUT A THOUSAND TIMES THE TEMPERATURE AT THE CENTER OF THE SUN BUT TEMPERATURES AS HIGH AS THIS ARE REACHED IN HBOMB EXPLOSIONS AT THIS TIME THE UNIVERSE WOULD HAVE CONTAINED MOSTLY PHOTONS ELECTRONS AND NEUTRINOS EXTREMELY LIGHT PARTICLES THAT ARE AFFECTED ONLY BY THE WEAK FORCE AND GRAVITY AND THEIR ANTIPARTICLES TOGETHER WITH SOME PROTONS AND NEUTRONS AS THE UNIVERSE CONTINUED TO EXPAND AND THE TEMPERATURE TO DROP THE RATE AT WHICH ELECTRONANTIELECTRON PAIRS WERE BEING PRODUCED IN COLLISIONS WOULD HAVE FALLEN BELOW THE RATE AT WHICH THEY WERE BEING DESTROYED BY ANNIHILATION SO MOST OF THE ELECTRONS AND ANTIELECTRONS WOULD HAVE ANNIHILATED WITH EACH OTHER TO PRODUCE MORE PHOTONS LEAVING ONLY A FEW ELECTRONS LEFT OVER THE NEUTRINOS AND ANTINEUTRINOS HOWEVER WOULD NOT HAVE ANNIHILATED WITH EACH OTHER BECAUSE THESE PARTICLES INTERACT WITH THEMSELVES AND WITH OTHER PARTICLES ONLY VERY WEAKLY SO THEY SHOULD STILL BE AROUND TODAY IF WE COULD OBSERVE THEM IT WOULD PROVIDE A GOOD TEST OF THIS PICTURE OF A VERY HOT EARLY STAGE OF THE UNIVERSE UNFORTUNATELY THEIR ENERGIES NOWADAYS WOULD BE TOO LOW FOR US TO OBSERVE THEM DIRECTLY HOWEVER IF NEUTRINOS ARE NOT MASSLESS BUT HAVE A SMALL MASS OF THEIR OWN AS SUGGESTED BY SOME RECENT EXPERIMENTS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DETECT THEM INDIRECTLY THEY COULD BE A FORM OF DARK MATTER LIKE THAT MENTIONED EARLIER WITH SUFFICIENT GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION TO STOP THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE AND CAUSE IT TO COLLAPSE AGAIN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SECONDS AFTER THE BIG BANG THE TEMPERATURE WOULD HAVE FALLEN TO ONE THOUSAND MILLION DEGREES THE TEMPERATURE INSIDE THE HOTTEST STARS AT THIS TEMPERATURE PROTONS AND NEUTRONS WOULD NO LONGER HAVE SUFFICIENT ENERGY TO ESCAPE THE ATTRACTION OF THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE AND WOULD HAVE STARTED TO COMBINE TOGETHER TO PRODUCE THE NUCLEI OF ATOMS OF DEUTERIUM HEAVY HYDROGEN WHICH CONTAIN ONE PROTON AND ONE NEUTRON THE DEUTERIUM NUCLEI WOULD THEN HAVE COMBINED WITH MORE PROTONS AND NEUTRONS TO MAKE HELIUM NUCLEI WHICH CONTAIN TWO PROTONS AND TWO NEUTRONS AND ALSO SMALL AMOUNTS OF A COUPLE OF HEAVIER ELEMENTS LITHIUM AND BERYLLIUM ONE CAN CALCULATE THAT IN THE HOT BIG BANG MODEL ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE PROTONS AND NEUTRONS WOULD HAVE BEEN CONVERTED INTO HELIUM NUCLEI ALONG WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF HEAVY HYDROGEN AND OTHER ELEMENTS THE REMAINING NEUTRONS WOULD HAVE DECAYED INTO PROTONS WHICH ARE THE NUCLEI OF ORDINARY HYDROGEN ATOMS THIS PICTURE OF A HOT EARLY STAGE OF THE UNIVERSE WAS FIRST PUT FORWARD BY THE SCIENTIST GEORGE GAMOW IN A FAMOUS PAPER WRITTEN IN WITH A STUDENT OF HIS RALPH ALPHER GAMOW HAD QUITE A SENSE OF HUMOR HE PERSUADED THE NUCLEAR SCIENTIST HANS BETHE TO ADD HIS NAME TO THE PAPER TO MAKE THE LIST OF AUTHORS ALPHER BETHE GAMOW LIKE THE FIRST THREE LETTERS OF THE GREEK ALPHABET ALPHA BETA GAMMA PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE FOR A PAPER ON THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE IN THIS PAPER THEY MADE THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION THAT RADIATION IN THE FORM OF PHOTONS FROM THE VERY HOT EARLY STAGES OF THE UNIVERSE SHOULD STILL BE AROUND TODAY BUT WITH ITS TEMPERATURE REDUCED TO ONLY A FEW DEGREES ABOVE ABSOLUTE ZERO C IT WAS THIS RADIATION THAT PENZIAS AND WILSON FOUND IN AT THE TIME THAT ALPHER BETHE AND GAMOW WROTE THEIR PAPER NOT MUCH WAS KNOWN ABOUT THE NUCLEAR REACTIONS OF PROTONS AND NEUTRONS PREDICTIONS MADE FOR THE PROPORTIONS OF VARIOUS ELEMENTS IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE WERE THEREFORE RATHER INACCURATE BUT THESE CALCULATIONS HAVE BEEN REPEATED IN THE LIGHT OF BETTER KNOWLEDGE AND NOW AGREE VERY WELL WITH WHAT WE OBSERVE IT IS MOREOVER VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN IN ANY OTHER WAY WHY THERE SHOULD BE SO MUCH HELIUM IN THE UNIVERSE WE ARE THEREFORE FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT PICTURE AT LEAST BACK TO ABOUT ONE SECOND AFTER THE BIG BANG WITHIN ONLY A FEW HOURS OF THE BIG BANG THE PRODUCTION OF HELIUM AND OTHER ELEMENTS WOULD HAVE STOPPED AND AFTER THAT FOR THE NEXT MILLION YEARS OR SO THE UNIVERSE WOULD HAVE JUST CONTINUED EXPANDING WITHOUT ANYTHING MUCH HAPPENING EVENTUALLY ONCE THE TEMPERATURE HAD DROPPED TO A FEW THOUSAND DEGREES AND ELECTRONS AND NUCLEI NO LONGER HAD ENOUGH ENERGY TO OVERCOME THE ELECTROMAGNETIC ATTRACTION BETWEEN THEM THEY WOULD HAVE STARTED COMBINING TO FORM ATOMS THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE WOULD HAVE CONTINUED EXPANDING AND COOLING BUT IN REGIONS THAT WERE SLIGHTLY DENSER THAN AVERAGE THE EXPANSION WOULD HAVE BEEN SLOWED DOWN BY THE EXTRA GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION THIS WOULD EVENTUALLY STOP EXPANSION IN SOME REGIONS AND CAUSE THEM TO START TO RECOLLAPSE AS THEY WERE COLLAPSING THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL OF MATTER OUTSIDE THESE REGIONS MIGHT START THEM ROTATING SLIGHTLY AS THE COLLAPSING REGION GOT SMALLER IT WOULD SPIN FASTER JUST AS SKATERS SPINNING ON ICE SPIN FASTER AS THEY DRAW IN THEIR ARMS EVENTUALLY WHEN THE REGION GOT SMALL ENOUGH IT WOULD BE SPINNING FAST ENOUGH TO BALANCE THE ATTRACTION OF GRAVITY AND IN THIS WAY DISKLIKE ROTATING GALAXIES WERE BORN OTHER REGIONS WHICH DID NOT HAPPEN TO PICK UP A ROTATION WOULD BECOME OVALSHAPED OBJECTS CALLED ELLIPTICAL GALAXIES IN THESE THE REGION WOULD STOP COLLAPSING BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL PARTS OF THE GALAXY WOULD BE ORBITING STABLY ROUND ITS CENTER BUT THE GALAXY WOULD HAVE NO OVERALL ROTATION AS TIME WENT ON THE HYDROGEN AND HELIUM GAS IN THE GALAXIES WOULD BREAK UP INTO SMALLER CLOUDS THAT WOULD COLLAPSE UNDER THEIR OWN GRAVITY AS THESE CONTRACTED AND THE ATOMS WITHIN THEM COLLIDED WITH ONE ANOTHER THE TEMPERATURE OF THE GAS WOULD INCREASE UNTIL EVENTUALLY IT BECAME HOT ENOUGH TO START NUCLEAR FUSION REACTIONS THESE WOULD CONVERT THE HYDROGEN INTO MORE HELIUM AND THE HEAT GIVEN OFF WOULD RAISE THE PRESSURE AND SO STOP THE CLOUDS FROM CONTRACTING ANY FURTHER THEY WOULD REMAIN STABLE IN THIS STATE FOR A LONG TIME AS STARS LIKE OUR SUN BURNING HYDROGEN INTO HELIUM AND RADIATING THE RESULTING ENERGY AS HEAT AND LIGHT MORE MASSIVE STARS WOULD NEED TO BE HOTTER TO BALANCE THEIR STRONGER GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION MAKING THE NUCLEAR FUSION REACTIONS PROCEED SO MUCH MORE RAPIDLY THAT THEY WOULD USE UP THEIR HYDROGEN IN AS LITTLE AS A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS THEY WOULD THEN CONTRACT SLIGHTLY AND AS THEY HEATED UP FURTHER WOULD START TO CONVERT HELIUM INTO HEAVIER ELEMENTS LIKE CARBON OR OXYGEN THIS HOWEVER WOULD NOT RELEASE MUCH MORE ENERGY SO A CRISIS WOULD OCCUR AS WAS DESCRIBED IN THE CHAPTER ON BLACK HOLES WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR BUT IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE CENTRAL REGIONS OF THE STAR WOULD COLLAPSE TO A VERY DENSE STATE SUCH AS A NEUTRON STAR OR BLACK HOLE THE OUTER REGIONS OF THE STAR MAY SOMETIMES GET BLOWN OFF IN A TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION CALLED A SUPERNOVA WHICH WOULD OUTSHINE ALL THE OTHER STARS IN ITS GALAXY SOME OF THE HEAVIER ELEMENTS PRODUCED NEAR THE END OF THE STARS LIFE WOULD BE FLUNG BACK INTO THE GAS IN THE GALAXY AND WOULD PROVIDE SOME OF THE RAW MATERIAL FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF STARS OUR OWN SUN CONTAINS ABOUT PERCENT OF THESE HEAVIER ELEMENTS BECAUSE IT IS A SECOND OR THIRDGENERATION STAR FORMED SOME FIVE THOUSAND MILLION YEARS AGO OUT OF A CLOUD OF ROTATING GAS CONTAINING THE DEBRIS OF EARLIER SUPERNOVAS MOST OF THE GAS IN THAT CLOUD WENT TO FORM THE SUN OR GOT BLOWN AWAY BUT A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE HEAVIER ELEMENTS COLLECTED TOGETHER TO FORM THE BODIES THAT NOW ORBIT THE SUN AS PLANETS LIKE THE EARTH THE EARTH WAS INITIALLY VERY HOT AND WITHOUT AN ATMOSPHERE IN THE COURSE OF TIME IT COOLED AND ACQUIRED AN ATMOSPHERE FROM THE EMISSION OF GASES FROM THE ROCKS THIS EARLY ATMOSPHERE WAS NOT ONE IN WHICH WE COULD HAVE SURVIVED IT CONTAINED NO OXYGEN BUT A LOT OF OTHER GASES THAT ARE POISONOUS TO US SUCH AS HYDROGEN SULFIDE THE GAS THAT GIVES ROTTEN EGGS THEIR SMELL THERE ARE HOWEVER OTHER PRIMITIVE FORMS OF LIFE THAT CAN FLOURISH UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS IT IS THOUGHT THAT THEY DEVELOPED IN THE OCEANS POSSIBLY AS A RESULT OF CHANCE COMBINATIONS OF ATOMS INTO LARGE STRUCTURES CALLED MACROMOLECULES WHICH WERE CAPABLE OF ASSEMBLING OTHER ATOMS IN THE OCEAN INTO SIMILAR STRUCTURES THEY WOULD THUS HAVE REPRODUCED THEMSELVES AND MULTIPLIED IN SOME CASES THERE WOULD BE ERRORS IN THE REPRODUCTION MOSTLY THESE ERRORS WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCH THAT THE NEW MACROMOLECULE COULD NOT REPRODUCE ITSELF AND EVENTUALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN DESTROYED HOWEVER A FEW OF THE ERRORS WOULD HAVE PRODUCED NEW MACROMOLECULES THAT WERE EVEN BETTER AT REPRODUCING THEMSELVES THEY WOULD HAVE THEREFORE HAD AN ADVANTAGE AND WOULD HAVE TENDED TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL MACROMOLECULES IN THIS WAY A PROCESS OF EVOLUTION WAS STARTED THAT LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE AND MORE COMPLICATED SELFREPRODUCING ORGANISMS THE FIRST PRIMITIVE FORMS OF LIFE CONSUMED VARIOUS MATERIALS INCLUDING HYDROGEN SULFIDE AND RELEASED OXYGEN THIS GRADUALLY CHANGED THE ATMOSPHERE TO THE COMPOSITION THAT IT HAS TODAY AND ALLOWED THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGHER FORMS OF LIFE SUCH AS FISH REPTILES MAMMALS AND ULTIMATELY THE HUMAN RACE THIS PICTURE OF A UNIVERSE THAT STARTED OFF VERY HOT AND COOLED AS IT EXPANDED IS IN AGREEMENT WITH ALL THE OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE TODAY NEVERTHELESS IT LEAVES A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT QUESTIONS UNANSWERED  WHY WAS THE EARLY UNIVERSE SO HOT  WHY IS THE UNIVERSE SO UNIFORM ON A LARGE SCALE WHY DOES IT LOOK THE SAME AT ALL POINTS OF SPACE AND IN ALL DIRECTIONS IN PARTICULAR WHY IS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE MICROWAVE BACKGROUND RADIATION SO NEARLY THE SAME WHEN WE LOOK IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS IT IS A BIT LIKE ASKING A NUMBER OF STUDENTS AN EXAM QUESTION IF THEY ALL GIVE EXACTLY THE SAME ANSWER YOU CAN BE PRETTY SURE THEY HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH EACH OTHER YET IN THE MODEL DESCRIBED ABOVE THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TIME SINCE THE BIG BANG FOR LIGHT TO GET FROM ONE DISTANT REGION TO ANOTHER EVEN THOUGH THE REGIONS WERE CLOSE TOGETHER IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE ACCORDING TO THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY IF LIGHT CANNOT GET FROM ONE REGION TO ANOTHER NO OTHER INFORMATION CAN SO THERE WOULD BE NO WAY IN WHICH DIFFERENT REGIONS IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE COULD HAVE COME TO HAVE THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS EACH OTHER UNLESS FOR SOME UNEXPLAINED REASON THEY HAPPENED TO START OUT WITH THE SAME TEMPERATURE  WHY DID THE UNIVERSE START OUT WITH SO NEARLY THE CRITICAL RATE OF EXPANSION THAT SEPARATES MODELS THAT RECOLLAPSE FROM THOSE THAT GO ON EXPANDING FOREVER THAT EVEN NOW TEN THOUSAND MILLION YEARS LATER IT IS STILL EXPANDING AT NEARLY THE CRITICAL RATE IF THE RATE OF EXPANSION ONE SECOND AFTER THE BIG BANG HAD BEEN SMALLER BY EVEN ONE PART IN A HUNDRED THOUSAND MILLION MILLION THE UNIVERSE WOULD HAVE RECOLLAPSED BEFORE IT EVER REACHED ITS PRESENT SIZE  DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE UNIVERSE IS SO UNIFORM AND HOMOGENEOUS ON A LARGE SCALE IT CONTAINS LOCAL IRREGULARITIES SUCH AS STARS AND GALAXIES THESE ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE DEVELOPED FROM SMALL DIFFERENCES IN THE DENSITY OF THE EARLY UNIVERSE FROM ONE REGION TO ANOTHER WHAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THESE DENSITY FLUCTUATIONS THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ON ITS OWN CANNOT EXPLAIN THESE FEATURES OR ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF ITS PREDICTION THAT THE UNIVERSE STARTED OFF WITH INFINITE DENSITY AT THE BIG BANG SINGULARITY AT THE SINGULARITY GENERAL RELATIVITY AND ALL OTHER PHYSICAL LAWS WOULD BREAK DOWN ONE COULDNT PREDICT WHAT WOULD COME OUT OF THE SINGULARITY AS EXPLAINED BEFORE THIS MEANS THAT ONE MIGHT AS WELL CUT THE BIG BANG AND ANY EVENTS BEFORE IT OUT OF THE THEORY BECAUSE THEY CAN HAVE NO EFFECT ON WHAT WE OBSERVE SPACETIME WOULD HAVE A BOUNDARY A BEGINNING AT THE BIG BANG SCIENCE SEEMS TO HAVE UNCOVERED A SET OF LAWS THAT WITHIN THE LIMITS SET BY THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE TELL US HOW THE UNIVERSE WILL DEVELOP WITH TIME IF WE KNOW ITS STATE AT ANY ONE TIME THESE LAWS MAY HAVE ORIGINALLY BEEN DECREED BY GOD BUT IT APPEARS THAT HE HAS SINCE LEFT THE UNIVERSE TO EVOLVE ACCORDING TO THEM AND DOES NOT NOW INTERVENE IN IT BUT HOW DID HE CHOOSE THE INITIAL STATE OR CONFIGURATION OF THE UNIVERSE WHAT WERE THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME ONE POSSIBLE ANSWER IS TO SAY THAT GOD CHOSE THE INITIAL CONFIGURATION OF THE UNIVERSE FOR REASONS THAT WE CANNOT HOPE TO UNDERSTAND THIS WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN WITHIN THE POWER OF AN OMNIPOTENT BEING BUT IF HE HAD STARTED IT OFF IN SUCH AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE WAY WHY DID HE CHOOSE TO LET IT EVOLVE ACCORDING TO LAWS THAT WE COULD UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE HISTORY OF SCIENCE HAS BEEN THE GRADUAL REALIZATION THAT EVENTS DO NOT HAPPEN IN AN ARBITRARY MANNER BUT THAT THEY REFLECT A CERTAIN UNDERLYING ORDER WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE DIVINELY INSPIRED IT WOULD BE ONLY NATURAL TO SUPPOSE THAT THIS ORDER SHOULD APPLY NOT ONLY TO THE LAWS BUT ALSO TO THE CONDITIONS AT THE BOUNDARY OF SPACETIME THAT SPECIFY THE INITIAL STATE OF THE UNIVERSE THERE MAY BE A LARGE NUMBER OF MODELS OF THE UNIVERSE WITH DIFFERENT INITIAL CONDITIONS THAT ALL OBEY THE LAWS THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME PRINCIPLE THAT PICKS OUT ONE INITIAL STATE AND HENCE ONE MODEL TO REPRESENT OUR UNIVERSE ONE SUCH POSSIBILITY IS WHAT ARE CALLED CHAOTIC BOUNDARY CONDITIONS THESE IMPLICITLY ASSUME EITHER THAT THE UNIVERSE IS SPATIALLY INFINITE OR THAT THERE ARE INFINITELY MANY UNIVERSES UNDER CHAOTIC BOUNDARY CONDITIONS THE PROBABILITY OF FINDING ANY PARTICULAR REGION OF SPACE IN ANY GIVEN CONFIGURATION JUST AFTER THE BIG BANG IS THE SAME IN SOME SENSE AS THE PROBABILITY OF FINDING IT IN ANY OTHER CONFIGURATION THE INITIAL STATE OF THE UNIVERSE IS CHOSEN PURELY RANDOMLY THIS WOULD MEAN THAT THE EARLY UNIVERSE WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN VERY CHAOTIC AND IRREGULAR BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY MORE CHAOTIC AND DISORDERED CONFIGURATIONS FOR THE UNIVERSE THAN THERE ARE SMOOTH AND ORDERED ONES IF EACH CONFIGURATION IS EQUALLY PROBABLE IT IS LIKELY THAT THE UNIVERSE STARTED OUT IN A CHAOTIC AND DISORDERED STATE SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MORE OF THEM IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW SUCH CHAOTIC INITIAL CONDITIONS COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO A UNIVERSE THAT IS SO SMOOTH AND REGULAR ON A LARGE SCALE AS OURS IS TODAY ONE WOULD ALSO HAVE EXPECTED THE DENSITY FLUCTUATIONS IN SUCH A MODEL TO HAVE LED TO THE FORMATION OF MANY MORE PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES THAN THE UPPER LIMIT THAT HAS BEEN SET BY OBSERVATIONS OF THE GAMMA RAY BACKGROUND IF THE UNIVERSE IS INDEED SPATIALLY INFINITE OR IF THERE ARE INFINITELY MANY UNIVERSES THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE SOME LARGE REGIONS SOMEWHERE THAT STARTED OUT IN A SMOOTH AND UNIFORM MANNER IT IS A BIT LIKE THE WELLKNOWN HORDE OF MONKEYS HAMMERING AWAY ON TYPEWRITERS MOST OF WHAT THEY WRITE WILL BE GARBAGE BUT VERY OCCASIONALLY BY PURE CHANCE THEY WILL TYPE OUT ONE OF SHAKESPEARES SONNETS SIMILARLY IN THE CASE OF THE UNIVERSE COULD IT BE THAT WE ARE LIVING IN A REGION THAT JUST HAPPENS BY CHANCE TO BE SMOOTH AND UNIFORM AT FIRST SIGHT THIS MIGHT SEEM VERY IMPROBABLE BECAUSE SUCH SMOOTH REGIONS WOULD BE HEAVILY OUTNUMBERED BY CHAOTIC AND IRREGULAR REGIONS HOWEVER SUPPOSE THAT ONLY IN THE SMOOTH REGIONS WERE GALAXIES AND STARS FORMED AND WERE CONDITIONS RIGHT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLICATED SELFREPLICATING ORGANISMS LIKE OURSELVES WHO WERE CAPABLE OF ASKING THE QUESTION WHY IS THE UNIVERSE SO SMOOTH THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE APPLICATION OF WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE WHICH CAN BE PARAPHRASED AS WE SEE THE UNIVERSE THE WAY IT IS BECAUSE WE EXIST THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS OF THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE THE WEAK AND THE STRONG THE WEAK ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE STATES THAT IN A UNIVERSE THAT IS LARGE OR INFINITE IN SPACE ANDOR TIME THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENT LIFE WILL BE MET ONLY IN CERTAIN REGIONS THAT ARE LIMITED IN SPACE AND TIME THE INTELLIGENT BEINGS IN THESE REGIONS SHOULD THEREFORE NOT BE SURPRISED IF THEY OBSERVE THAT THEIR LOCALITY IN THE UNIVERSE SATISFIES THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THEIR EXISTENCE IT IS A BIT LIKE A RICH PERSON LIVING IN A WEALTHY NEIGHBORHOOD NOT SEEING ANY POVERTY ONE EXAMPLE OF THE USE OF THE WEAK ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE IS TO EXPLAIN WHY THE BIG BANG OCCURRED ABOUT TEN THOUSAND MILLION YEARS AGO IT TAKES ABOUT THAT LONG FOR INTELLIGENT BEINGS TO EVOLVE AS EXPLAINED ABOVE AN EARLY GENERATION OF STARS FIRST HAD TO FORM THESE STARS CONVERTED SOME OF THE ORIGINAL HYDROGEN AND HELIUM INTO ELEMENTS LIKE CARBON AND OXYGEN OUT OF WHICH WE ARE MADE THE STARS THEN EXPLODED AS SUPERNOVAS AND THEIR DEBRIS WENT TO FORM OTHER STARS AND PLANETS AMONG THEM THOSE OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM WHICH IS ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND MILLION YEARS OLD THE FIRST ONE OR TWO THOUSAND MILLION YEARS OF THE EARTHS EXISTENCE WERE TOO HOT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANYTHING COMPLICATED THE REMAINING THREE THOUSAND MILLION YEARS OR SO HAVE BEEN TAKEN UP BY THE SLOW PROCESS OF BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION WHICH HAS LED FROM THE SIMPLEST ORGANISMS TO BEINGS WHO ARE CAPABLE OF MEASURING TIME BACK TO THE BIG BANG FEW PEOPLE WOULD QUARREL WITH THE VALIDITY OR UTILITY OF THE WEAK ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE SOME HOWEVER GO MUCH FURTHER AND PROPOSE A STRONG VERSION OF THE PRINCIPLE ACCORDING TO THIS THEORY THERE ARE EITHER MANY DIFFERENT UNIVERSES OR MANY DIFFERENT REGIONS OF A SINGLE UNIVERSE EACH WITH ITS OWN INITIAL CONFIGURATION AND PERHAPS WITH ITS OWN SET OF LAWS OF SCIENCE IN MOST OF THESE UNIVERSES THE CONDITIONS WOULD NOT BE RIGHT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLICATED ORGANISMS ONLY IN THE FEW UNIVERSES THAT ARE LIKE OURS WOULD INTELLIGENT BEINGS DEVELOP AND ASK THE QUESTION WHY IS THE UNIVERSE THE WAY WE SEE IT THE ANSWER IS THEN SIMPLE IF IT HAD BEEN DIFFERENT WE WOULD NOT BE HERE THE LAWS OF SCIENCE AS WE KNOW THEM AT PRESENT CONTAIN MANY FUNDAMENTAL NUMBERS LIKE THE SIZE OF THE ELECTRIC CHARGE OF THE ELECTRON AND THE RATIO OF THE MASSES OF THE PROTON AND THE ELECTRON WE CANNOT AT THE MOMENT AT LEAST PREDICT THE VALUES OF THESE NUMBERS FROM THEORY WE HAVE TO FIND THEM BY OBSERVATION IT MAY BE THAT ONE DAY WE SHALL DISCOVER A COMPLETE UNIFIED THEORY THAT PREDICTS THEM ALL BUT IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT SOME OR ALL OF THEM VARY FROM UNIVERSE TO UNIVERSE OR WITHIN A SINGLE UNIVERSE THE REMARKABLE FACT IS THAT THE VALUES OF THESE NUMBERS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN VERY FINELY ADJUSTED TO MAKE POSSIBLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIFE FOR EXAMPLE IF THE ELECTRIC CHARGE OF THE ELECTRON HAD BEEN ONLY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STARS EITHER WOULD HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO BURN HYDROGEN AND HELIUM OR ELSE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE EXPLODED OF COURSE THERE MIGHT BE OTHER FORMS OF INTELLIGENT LIFE NOT DREAMED OF EVEN BY WRITERS OF SCIENCE FICTION THAT DID NOT REQUIRE THE LIGHT OF A STAR LIKE THE SUN OR THE HEAVIER CHEMICAL ELEMENTS THAT ARE MADE IN STARS AND ARE FLUNG BACK INTO SPACE WHEN THE STARS EXPLODE NEVERTHELESS IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW RANGES OF VALUES FOR THE NUMBERS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANY FORM OF INTELLIGENT LIFE MOST SETS OF VALUES WOULD GIVE RISE TO UNIVERSES THAT ALTHOUGH THEY MIGHT BE VERY BEAUTIFUL WOULD CONTAIN NO ONE ABLE TO WONDER AT THAT BEAUTY ONE CAN TAKE THIS EITHER AS EVIDENCE OF A DIVINE PURPOSE IN CREATION AND THE CHOICE OF THE LAWS OF SCIENCE OR AS SUPPORT FOR THE STRONG ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OBJECTIONS THAT ONE CAN RAISE TO THE STRONG ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE AS AN EXPLANATION OF THE OBSERVED STATE OF THE UNIVERSE FIRST IN WHAT SENSE CAN ALL THESE DIFFERENT UNIVERSES BE SAID TO EXIST IF THEY ARE REALLY SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER WHAT HAPPENS IN ANOTHER UNIVERSE CAN HAVE NO OBSERVABLE CONSEQUENCES IN OUR OWN UNIVERSE WE SHOULD THEREFORE USE THE PRINCIPLE OF ECONOMY AND CUT THEM OUT OF THE THEORY IF ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ARE JUST DIFFERENT REGIONS OF A SINGLE UNIVERSE THE LAWS OF SCIENCE WOULD HAVE TO BE THE SAME IN EACH REGION BECAUSE OTHERWISE ONE COULD NOT MOVE CONTINUOUSLY FROM ONE REGION TO ANOTHER IN THIS CASE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REGIONS WOULD BE THEIR INITIAL CONFIGURATIONS AND SO THE STRONG ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE WOULD REDUCE TO THE WEAK ONE A SECOND OBJECTION TO THE STRONG ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE IS THAT IT RUNS AGAINST THE TIDE OF THE WHOLE HISTORY OF SCIENCE WE HAVE DEVELOPED FROM THE GEOCENTRIC COSMOLOGIES OF PTOLEMY AND HIS FOREBEARS THROUGH THE HELIOCENTRIC COSMOLOGY OF COPERNICUS AND GALILEO TO THE MODERN PICTURE IN WHICH THE EARTH IS A MEDIUMSIZED PLANET ORBITING AROUND AN AVERAGE STAR IN THE OUTER SUBURBS OF AN ORDINARY SPIRAL GALAXY WHICH IS ITSELF ONLY ONE OF ABOUT A MILLION MILLION GALAXIES IN THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE YET THE STRONG ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE WOULD CLAIM THAT THIS WHOLE VAST CONSTRUCTION EXISTS SIMPLY FOR OUR SAKE THIS IS VERY HARD TO BELIEVE OUR SOLAR SYSTEM IS CERTAINLY A PREREQUISITE FOR OUR EXISTENCE HAND ONE MIGHT EXTEND THIS TO THE WHOLE OF OUR GALAXY TO ALLOW FOR AN EARLIER GENERATION OF STARS THAT CREATED THE HEAVIER ELEMENTS BUT THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ANY NEED FOR ALL THOSE OTHER GALAXIES NOR FOR THE UNIVERSE TO BE SO UNIFORM AND SIMILAR IN EVERY DIRECTION ON THE LARGE SCALE ONE WOULD FEEL HAPPIER ABOUT THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE AT LEAST IN ITS WEAK VERSION IF ONE COULD SHOW THAT QUITE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INITIAL CONFIGURATIONS FOR THE UNIVERSE WOULD HAVE EVOLVED TO PRODUCE A UNIVERSE LIKE THE ONE WE OBSERVE IF THIS IS THE CASE A UNIVERSE THAT DEVELOPED FROM SOME SORT OF RANDOM INITIAL CONDITIONS SHOULD CONTAIN A NUMBER OF REGIONS THAT ARE SMOOTH AND UNIFORM AND ARE SUITABLE FOR THE EVOLUTION OF INTELLIGENT LIFE ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE INITIAL STATE OF THE UNIVERSE HAD TO BE CHOSEN EXTREMELY CAREFULLY TO LEAD TO SOMETHING LIKE WHAT WE SEE AROUND US THE UNIVERSE WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO CONTAIN ANY REGION IN WHICH LIFE WOULD APPEAR IN THE HOT BIG BANG MODEL DESCRIBED ABOVE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH TIME IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE FOR HEAT TO HAVE FLOWED FROM ONE REGION TO ANOTHER THIS MEANS THAT THE INITIAL STATE OF THE UNIVERSE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE HAD EXACTLY THE SAME TEMPERATURE EVERYWHERE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT THE MICROWAVE BACKGROUND HAS THE SAME TEMPERATURE IN EVERY DIRECTION WE LOOK THE INITIAL RATE OF EXPANSION ALSO WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE CHOSEN VERY PRECISELY FOR THE RATE OF EXPANSION STILL TO BE SO CLOSE TO THE CRITICAL RATE NEEDED TO AVOID RECOLLAPSE THIS MEANS THAT THE INITIAL STATE OF THE UNIVERSE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFULLY CHOSEN INDEED IF THE HOT BIG BANG MODEL WAS CORRECT RIGHT BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF TIME IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN WHY THE UNIVERSE SHOULD HAVE BEGUN IN JUST THIS WAY EXCEPT AS THE ACT OF A GOD WHO INTENDED TO CREATE BEINGS LIKE US IN AN ATTEMPT TO FIND A MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE IN WHICH MANY DIFFERENT INITIAL CONFIGURATIONS COULD HAVE EVOLVED TO SOMETHING LIKE THE PRESENT UNIVERSE A SCIENTIST AT THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY ALAN GUTH SUGGESTED THAT THE EARLY UNIVERSE MIGHT HAVE GONE THROUGH A PERIOD OF VERY RAPID EXPANSION THIS EXPANSION IS SAID TO BE INFLATIONARY MEANING THAT THE UNIVERSE AT ONE TIME EXPANDED AT AN INCREASING RATE RATHER THAN THE DECREASING RATE THAT IT DOES TODAY ACCORDING TO GUTH THE RADIUS OF THE UNIVERSE INCREASED BY A MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION  WITH THIRTY ZEROS AFTER IT TIMES IN ONLY A TINY FRACTION OF A SECOND GUTH SUGGESTED THAT THE UNIVERSE STARTED OUT FROM THE BIG BANG IN A VERY HOT BUT RATHER CHAOTIC STATE THESE HIGH TEMPERATURES WOULD HAVE MEANT THAT THE PARTICLES IN THE UNIVERSE WOULD BE MOVING VERY FAST AND WOULD HAVE HIGH ENERGIES AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER ONE WOULD EXPECT THAT AT SUCH HIGH TEMPERATURES THE STRONG AND WEAK NUCLEAR FORCES AND THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE WOULD ALL BE UNIFIED INTO A SINGLE FORCE AS THE UNIVERSE EXPANDED IT WOULD COOL AND PARTICLE ENERGIES WOULD GO DOWN EVENTUALLY THERE WOULD BE WHAT IS CALLED A PHASE TRANSITION AND THE SYMMETRY BETWEEN THE FORCES WOULD BE BROKEN THE STRONG FORCE WOULD BECOME DIFFERENT FROM THE WEAK AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCES ONE COMMON EXAMPLE OF A PHASE TRANSITION IS THE FREEZING OF WATER WHEN YOU COOL IT DOWN LIQUID WATER IS SYMMETRICAL THE SAME AT EVERY POINT AND IN EVERY DIRECTION HOWEVER WHEN ICE CRYSTALS FORM THEY WILL HAVE DEFINITE POSITIONS AND WILL BE LINED UP IN SOME DIRECTION THIS BREAKS WATERS SYMMETRY IN THE CASE OF WATER IF ONE IS CAREFUL ONE CAN SUPERCOOL IT THAT IS ONE CAN REDUCE THE TEMPERATURE BELOW THE FREEZING POINT C WITHOUT ICE FORMING GUTH SUGGESTED THAT THE UNIVERSE MIGHT BEHAVE IN A SIMILAR WAY THE TEMPERATURE MIGHT DROP BELOW THE CRITICAL VALUE WITHOUT THE SYMMETRY BETWEEN THE FORCES BEING BROKEN IF THIS HAPPENED THE UNIVERSE WOULD BE IN AN UNSTABLE STATE WITH MORE ENERGY THAN IF THE SYMMETRY HAD BEEN BROKEN THIS SPECIAL EXTRA ENERGY CAN BE SHOWN TO HAVE AN ANTIGRAVITATIONAL EFFECT IT WOULD HAVE ACTED JUST LIKE THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT THAT EINSTEIN INTRODUCED INTO GENERAL RELATIVITY WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO CONSTRUCT A STATIC MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE SINCE THE UNIVERSE WOULD ALREADY BE EXPANDING JUST AS IN THE HOT BIG BANG MODEL THE REPULSIVE EFFECT OFOWMASS BLACK HOLES COULD FORM ONLY IF MATTER WAS COMPRESSED TO ENORMOUS DENSITIES BY VERY LARGE EXTERNAL PRESSURES SUCH CONDITIONS COULD OCCUR IN A VERY BIG HYDROGEN BOMB THE PHYSICIST JOHN WHEELER ONCE CALCULATED THAT IF ONE TOOK ALL THE HEAVY WATER IN ALL THE OCEANS OF THE WORLD ONE COULD BUILD A HYDROGEN BOMB THAT WOULD COMPRESS MATTER AT THE CENTER SO MUCH THAT A BLACK HOLE WOULD BE CREATED OF COURSE THERE WOULD BE NO ONE LEFT TO OBSERVE IT A MORE PRACTICAL POSSIBILITY IS THAT SUCH LOWMASS BLACK HOLES MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORMED IN THE HIGH TEMPERATURES AND PRESSURES OF THE VERY EARLY UNIVERSE BLACK HOLES WOULD HAVE BEEN FORMED ONLY IF THE EARLY UNIVERSE HAD NOT BEEN PERFECTLY SMOOTH AND UNIFORM BECAUSE ONLY A SMALL REGION THAT WAS DENSER THAN AVERAGE COULD BE COMPRESSED IN THIS WAY TO FORM A BLACK HOLE BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME IRREGULARITIES BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE WOULD STILL BE PERFECTLY UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED AT THE PRESENT EPOCH INSTEAD OF BEING CLUMPED TOGETHER IN STARS AND GALAXIES WHETHER THE IRREGULARITIES REQUIRED TO ACCOUNT FOR STARS AND GALAXIES WOULD HAVE LED TO THE FORMATION OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES CLEARLY DEPENDS ON THE DETAILS OF THE CONDITIONS IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE SO IF WE COULD DETERMINE HOW MANY PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES THERE ARE NOW WE WOULD LEARN A LOT ABOUT THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF THE UNIVERSE PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES WITH MASSES MORE THAN A THOUSAND MILLION TONS THE MASS OF A LARGE MOUNTAIN COULD BE DETECTED ONLY BY THEIR GRAVITATIONAL INFLUENCE ON OTHER VISIBLE MATTER OR ON THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE HOWEVER AS WE SHALL LEARN IN THE NEXT CHAPTER BLACK HOLES ARE NOT REALLY BLACK AFTER ALL THEY GLOW LIKE A HOT BODY AND THE SMALLER THEY ARE THE MORE THEY GLOW SO PARADOXICALLY SMALLER BLACK HOLES MIGHT ACTUALLY TURN OUT TO BE EASIER TO DETECT THAN LARGE ONES BEFORE MY RESEARCH ON GENERAL RELATIVITY HAD CONCENTRATED MAINLY ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE HAD BEEN A BIG BANG SINGULARITY HOWEVER ONE EVENING IN NOVEMBER THAT YEAR SHORTLY AFTER THE BIRTH OF MY DAUGHTER LUCY I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT BLACK HOLES AS I WAS GETTING INTO BED MY DISABILITY MAKES THIS RATHER A SLOW PROCESS SO I HAD PLENTY OF TIME AT THAT DATE THERE WAS NO PRECISE DEFINITION OF WHICH POINTS IN SPACETIME LAY INSIDE A BLACK HOLE AND WHICH LAY OUTSIDE I HAD ALREADY DISCUSSED WITH ROGER PENROSE THE IDEA OF DEFINING A BLACK HOLE AS THE SET OF EVENTS FROM WHICH IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESCAPE TO A LARGE DISTANCE WHICH IS NOW THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED DEFINITION IT MEANS THAT THE BOUNDARY OF THE BLACK HOLE THE EVENT HORIZON IS FORMED BY THE LIGHT RAYS THAT JUST FAIL TO ESCAPE FROM THE BLACK HOLE HOVERING FOREVER JUST ON THE EDGE FIGURE IT IS A BIT LIKE RUNNING AWAY FROM THE POLICE AND JUST MANAGING TO KEEP ONE STEP AHEAD BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO GET CLEAR AWAY SUDDENLY I REALIZED THAT THE PATHS OF THESE LIGHT RAYS COULD NEVER APPROACH ONE ANOTHER IF THEY DID THEY MUST EVENTUALLY RUN INTO ONE ANOTHER IT WOULD BE LIKE MEETING SOMEONE ELSE RUNNING AWAY FROM THE POLICE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION YOU WOULD BOTH BE CAUGHT OR IN THIS CASE FALL INTO A BLACK HOLE BUT IF THESE LIGHT RAYS WERE SWALLOWED UP BY THE BLACK HOLE THEN THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ON THE BOUNDARY OF THE BLACK HOLE SO THE PATHS OF LIGHT RAYS IN THE EVENT HORIZON HAD ALWAYS TO BE MOVING PARALLEL TO OR AWAY FROM EACH OTHER ANOTHER WAY OF SEEING THIS IS THAT THE EVENT HORIZON THE BOUNDARY OF THE BLACK HOLE IS LIKE THE EDGE OF A SHADOW THE SHADOW OF IMPENDING DOOM IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHADOW CAST BY A SOURCE AT A GREAT DISTANCE SUCH AS THE SUN YOU WILL SEE THAT THE RAYS OF LIGHT IN THE EDGE ARE NOT APPROACHING EACH OTHER IF THE RAYS OF LIGHT THAT FORM THE EVENT HORIZON THE BOUNDARY OF THE BLACK HOLE CAN NEVER APPROACH EACH OTHER THE AREA OF THE EVENT HORIZON MIGHT STAY THE SAME OR INCREASE WITH TIME BUT IT COULD NEVER DECREASE BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THE RAYS OF LIGHT IN THE BOUNDARY WOULD HAVE TO BE APPROACHING EACH OTHER IN FACT THE AREA WOULD INCREASE WHENEVER MATTER OR RADIATION FELL INTO THE BLACK HOLE OR IF TWO BLACK HOLES COLLIDED AND MERGED TOGETHER TO FORM A SINGLE BLACK HOLE THE AREA OF THE EVENT HORIZON OF THE FINAL BLACK HOLE WOULD BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE SUM OF THE AREAS OF THE EVENT HORIZONS OF THE ORIGINAL BLACK HOLES FIGURE THIS NONDECREASING PROPERTY OF THE EVENT HORIZONS AREA PLACED AN IMPORTANT RESTRICTION ON THE POSSIBLE BEHAVIOR OF BLACK HOLES I WAS SO EXCITED WITH MY DISCOVERY THAT I DID NOT GET MUCH SLEEP THAT NIGHT THE NEXT DAY I RANG UP ROGER PENROSE HE AGREED WITH ME I THINK IN FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN AWARE OF THIS PROPERTY OF THE AREA HOWEVER HE HAD BEEN USING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF A BLACK HOLE HE HAD NOT REALIZED THAT THE BOUNDARIES OF THE BLACK HOLE ACCORDING TO THE TWO DEFINITIONS WOULD BE THE SAME AND HENCE SO WOULD THEIR AREAS PROVIDED THE BLACK HOLE HAD SETTLED DOWN TO A STATE IN WHICH IT WAS NOT CHANGING WITH TIME THE NONDECREASING BEHAVIOR OF A BLACK HOLES AREA WAS VERY REMINISCENT OF THE BEHAVIOR OF A PHYSICAL QUANTITY CALLED ENTROPY WHICH MEASURES THE DEGREE OF DISORDER OF A SYSTEM IT IS A MATTER OF COMMON EXPERIENCE THAT DISORDER WILL TEND TO INCREASE IF THINGS ARE LEFT TO THEMSELVES ONE HAS ONLY TO STOP MAKING REPAIRS AROUND THE HOUSE TO SEE THAT ONE CAN CREATE ORDER OUT OF DISORDER FOR EXAMPLE ONE CAN PAINT THE HOUSE BUT THAT REQUIRES EXPENDITURE OF EFFORT OR ENERGY AND SO DECREASES THE AMOUNT OF ORDERED ENERGY AVAILABLE A PRECISE STATEMENT OF THIS IDEA IS KNOWN AS THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS IT STATES THAT THE ENTROPY OF AN ISOLATED SYSTEM ALWAYS INCREASES AND THAT WHEN TWO SYSTEMS ARE JOINED TOGETHER THE ENTROPY OF THE COMBINED SYSTEM IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE ENTROPIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL SYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE CONSIDER A SYSTEM OF GAS MOLECULES IN A BOX THE MOLECULES CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS LITTLE BILLIARD BALLS CONTINUALLY COLLIDING WITH EACH OTHER AND BOUNCING OFF THE WALLS OF THE BOX THE HIGHER THE TEMPERATURE OF THE GAS THE FASTER THE MOLECULES MOVE AND SO THE MORE FREQUENTLY AND HARDER THEY COLLIDE WITH THE WALLS OF THE BOX AND THE GREATER THE OUTWARD PRESSURE THEY EXERT ON THE WALLS SUPPOSE THAT INITIALLY THE MOLECULES ARE ALL CONFINED TO THE LEFTHAND SIDE OF THE BOX BY A PARTITION IF THE PARTITION IS THEN REMOVED THE MOLECULES WILL TEND TO SPREAD OUT AND OCCUPY BOTH HALVES OF THE BOX AT SOME LATER TIME THEY COULD BY CHANCE ALL BE IN THE RIGHT HALF OR BACK IN THE LEFT HALF BUT IT IS OVERWHELMINGLY MORE PROBABLE THAT THERE WILL BE ROUGHLY EQUAL NUMBERS IN THE TWO HALVES SUCH A STATE IS LESS ORDERED OR MORE DISORDERED THAN THE ORIGINAL STATE IN WHICH ALL THE MOLECULES WERE IN ONE HALF ONE THEREFORE SAYS THAT THE ENTROPY OF THE GAS HAS GONE UP SIMILARLY SUPPOSE ONE STARTS WITH TWO BOXES ONE CONTAINING OXYGEN MOLECULES AND THE OTHER CONTAINING NITROGEN MOLECULES IF ONE JOINS THE BOXES TOGETHER AND REMOVES THE INTERVENING WALL THE OXYGEN AND THE NITROGEN MOLECULES WILL START TO MIX AT A LATER TIME THE MOST PROBABLE STATE WOULD BE A FAIRLY UNIFORM MIXTURE OF OXYGEN AND NITROGEN MOLECULES THROUGHOUT THE TWO BOXES THIS STATE WOULD BE LESS ORDERED AND HENCE HAVE MORE ENTROPY THAN THE INITIAL STATE OF TWO SEPARATE BOXES THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS HAS A RATHER DIFFERENT STATUS THAN THAT OF OTHER LAWS OF SCIENCE SUCH AS NEWTONS LAW OF GRAVITY FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HOLD ALWAYS JUST IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES THE PROBABILITY OF ALL THE GAS MOLECULES IN OUR FIRST BOX FOUND IN ONE HALF OF THE BOX AT A LATER TIME IS MANY MILLIONS OF MILLIONS TO ONE BUT IT CAN HAPPEN HOWEVER IF ONE HAS A BLACK HOLE AROUND THERE SEEMS TO BE A RATHER EASIER WAY OF VIOLATING THE SECOND LAW JUST THROW SOME MATTER WITH A LOT OF ENTROPY SUCH AS A BOX OF GAS DOWN THE BLACK HOLE THE TOTAL ENTROPY OF MATTER OUTSIDE THE BLACK HOLE WOULD GO DOWN ONE COULD OF COURSE STILL SAY THAT THE TOTAL ENTROPY INCLUDING THE ENTROPY INSIDE THE BLACK HOLE HAS NOT GONE DOWN BUT SINCE THERE IS NO WAY TO LOOK INSIDE THE BLACK HOLE WE CANNOT SEE HOW MUCH ENTROPY THE MATTER INSIDE IT HAS IT WOULD BE NICE THEN IF THERE WAS SOME FEATURE OF THE BLACK HOLE BY WHICH OBSERVERS OUTSIDE THE BLACK HOLE COULD TELL ITS ENTROPY AND WHICH WOULD INCREASE WHENEVER MATTER CARRYING ENTROPY FELL INTO THE BLACK HOLE FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY DESCRIBED ABOVE THAT THE AREA OF THE EVENT HORIZON INCREASED WHENEVER MATTER FELL INTO A BLACK HOLE A RESEARCH STUDENT AT PRINCETON NAMED JACOB BEKENSTEIN SUGGESTED THAT THE AREA OF THE EVENT HORIZON WAS A MEASURE OF THE ENTROPY OF THE BLACK HOLE AS MATTER CARRYING ENTROPY FELL INTO A BLACK HOLE THE AREA OF ITS EVENT HORIZON WOULD GO UP SO THAT THE SUM OF THE ENTROPY OF MATTER OUTSIDE BLACK HOLES AND THE AREA OF THE HORIZONS WOULD NEVER GO DOWN THIS SUGGESTION SEEMED TO PREVENT THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS FROM BEING VIOLATED IN MOST SITUATIONS HOWEVER THERE WAS ONE FATAL FLAW IF A BLACK HOLE HAS ENTROPY THEN IT OUGHT TO ALSO HAVE A TEMPERATURE BUT A BODY WITH A PARTICULAR TEMPERATURE MUST EMIT RADIATION AT A CERTAIN RATE IT IS A MATTER OF COMMON EXPERIENCE THAT IF ONE HEATS UP A POKER IN A FIRE IT GLOWS RED HOT AND EMITS RADIATION BUT BODIES AT LOWER TEMPERATURES EMIT RADIATION TOO ONE JUST DOES NOT NORMALLY NOTICE IT BECAUSE THE AMOUNT IS FAIRLY SMALL THIS RADIATION IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO PREVENT VIOLATION OF THE SECOND LAW SO BLACK HOLES OUGHT TO EMIT RADIATION BUT BY THEIR VERY DEFINITION BLACK HOLES ARE OBJECTS THAT ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO EMIT ANYTHING IT THEREFORE SEEMED THAT THE AREA OF THE EVENT HORIZON OF A BLACK HOLE COULD NOT BE REGARDED AS ITS ENTROPY IN I WROTE A PAPER WITH BRANDON CARTER AND AN AMERICAN COLLEAGUE JIM BARDEEN IN WHICH WE POINTED OUT THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WERE MANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN ENTROPY AND THE AREA OF THE EVENT HORIZON THERE WAS THIS APPARENTLY FATAL DIFFICULTY I MUST ADMIT THAT IN WRITING THIS PAPER I WAS MOTIVATED PARTLY BY IRRITATION WITH BEKENSTEIN WHO I FELT HAD MISUSED MY DISCOVERY OF THE INCREASE OF THE AREA OF THE EVENT HORIZON HOWEVER IT TURNED OUT IN THE END THAT HE WAS BASICALLY CORRECT THOUGH IN A MANNER HE HAD CERTAINLY NOT EXPECTED IN SEPTEMBER WHILE I WAS VISITING MOSCOW I DISCUSSED BLACK HOLES WITH TWO LEADING SOVIET EXPERTS YAKOV ZELDOVICH AND ALEXANDER STAROBINSKY THEY CONVINCED ME THAT ACCORDING TO THE QUANTUM MECHANICAL UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE ROTATING BLACK HOLES SHOULD CREATE AND EMIT PARTICLES I BELIEVED THEIR ARGUMENTS ON PHYSICAL GROUNDS BUT I DID NOT LIKE THE MATHEMATICAL WAY IN WHICH THEY CALCULATED THE EMISSION I THEREFORE SET ABOUT DEVISING A BETTER MATHEMATICAL TREATMENT WHICH I DESCRIBED AT AN INFORMAL SEMINAR IN OXFORD AT THE END OF NOVEMBER AT THAT TIME I HAD NOT DONE THE CALCULATIONS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH WOULD ACTUALLY BE EMITTED I WAS EXPECTING TO DISCOVER JUST THE RADIATION THAT ZELDOVICH AND STAROBINSKY HAD PREDICTED FROM ROTATING BLACK HOLES HOWEVER WHEN I DID THE CALCULATION I FOUND TO MY SURPRISE AND ANNOYANCE THAT EVEN NONROTATING BLACK HOLES SHOULD APPARENTLY CREATE AND EMIT PARTICLES AT A STEADY RATE AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT THIS EMISSION INDICATED THAT ONE OF THE APPROXIMATIONS I HAD USED WAS NOT VALID I WAS AFRAID THAT IF BEKENSTEIN FOUND OUT ABOUT IT HE WOULD USE IT AS A FURTHER ARGUMENT TO SUPPORT HIS IDEAS ABOUT THE ENTROPY OF BLACK HOLES WHICH I STILL DID NOT LIKE HOWEVER THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT THE MORE IT SEEMED THAT THE APPROXIMATIONS REALLY OUGHT TO HOLD BUT WHAT FINALLY CONVINCED ME THAT THE EMISSION WAS REAL WAS THAT THE SPECTRUM OF THE EMITTED PARTICLES WAS EXACTLY THAT WHICH WOULD BE EMITTED BY A HOT BODY AND THAT THE BLACK HOLE WAS EMITTING PARTICLES AT EXACTLY THE CORRECT RATE TO PREVENT VIOLATIONS OF THE SECOND LAW SINCE THEN THE CALCULATIONS HAVE BEEN REPEATED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FORMS BY OTHER PEOPLE THEY ALL CONFIRM THAT A BLACK HOLE OUGHT TO EMIT PARTICLES AND RADIATION AS IF IT WERE A HOT BODY WITH A TEMPERATURE THAT DEPENDS ONLY ON THE BLACK HOLES MASS THE HIGHER THE MASS THE LOWER THE TEMPERATURE HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A BLACK HOLE APPEARS TO EMIT PARTICLES WHEN WE KNOW THAT NOTHING CAN ESCAPE FROM WITHIN ITS EVENT HORIZON THE ANSWER QUANTUM THEORY TELLS US IS THAT THE PARTICLES DO NOT COME FROM WITHIN THE BLACK HOLE BUT FROM THE EMPTY SPACE JUST OUTSIDE THE BLACK HOLES EVENT HORIZON WE CAN UNDERSTAND THIS IN THE FOLLOWING WAY WHAT WE THINK OF AS EMPTY SPACE CANNOT BE COMPLETELY EMPTY BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT ALL THE FIELDS SUCH AS THE GRAVITATIONAL AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS WOULD HAVE TO BE EXACTLY ZERO HOWEVER THE VALUE OF A FIELD AND ITS RATE OF CHANGE WITH TIME ARE LIKE THE POSITION AND VELOCITY OF A PARTICLE THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE IMPLIES THAT THE MORE ACCURATELY ONE KNOWS ONE OF THESE QUANTITIES THE LESS ACCURATELY ONE CAN KNOW THE OTHER SO IN EMPTY SPACE THE FIELD CANNOT BE FIXED AT EXACTLY ZERO BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD HAVE BOTH A PRECISE VALUE ZERO AND A PRECISE RATE OF CHANGE ALSO ZERO THERE MUST BE A CERTAIN MINIMUM AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY OR QUANTUM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THE FIELD ONE CAN THINK OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS AS PAIRS OF PARTICLES OF LIGHT OR GRAVITY THAT APPEAR TOGETHER AT SOME TIME MOVE APART AND THEN COME TOGETHER AGAIN AND ANNIHILATE EACH OTHER THESE PARTICLES ARE VIRTUAL PARTICLES LIKE THE PARTICLES THAT CARRY THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE OF THE SUN UNLIKE REAL PARTICLES THEY CANNOT BE OBSERVED DIRECTLY WITH A PARTICLE DETECTOR HOWEVER THEIR INDIRECT EFFECTS SUCH AS SMALL CHANGES IN THE ENERGY OF ELECTRON ORBITS IN ATOMS CAN BE MEASURED AND AGREE WITH THE THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS TO A REMARKABLE DEGREE OF ACCURACY THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE ALSO PREDICTS THAT THERE WILL BE SIMILAR VIRTUAL PAIRS OF MATTER PARTICLES SUCH AS ELECTRONS OR QUARKS IN THIS CASE HOWEVER ONE MEMBER OF THE PAIR WILL BE A PARTICLE AND THE OTHER AN ANTIPARTICLE THE ANTIPARTICLES OF LIGHT AND GRAVITY ARE THE SAME AS THE PARTICLES BECAUSE ENERGY CANNOT BE CREATED OUT OF NOTHING ONE OF THE PARTNERS IN A PARTICLEANTIPARTICLE PAIR WILL HAVE POSITIVE ENERGY AND THE OTHER PARTNER NEGATIVE ENERGY THE ONE WITH NEGATIVE ENERGY IS CONDEMNED TO BE A SHORTLIVED VIRTUAL PARTICLE BECAUSE REAL PARTICLES ALWAYS HAVE POSITIVE ENERGY IN NORMAL SITUATIONS IT MUST THEREFORE SEEK OUT ITS PARTNER AND ANNIHILATE WITH IT HOWEVER A REAL PARTICLE CLOSE TO A MASSIVE BODY HAS LESS ENERGY THAN IF IT WERE FAR AWAY BECAUSE IT WOULD TAKE ENERGY TO LIFT IT FAR AWAY AGAINST THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION OF THE BODY NORMALLY THE ENERGY OF THE PARTICLE IS STILL POSITIVE BUT THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD INSIDE A BLACK HOLE IS SO STRONG THAT EVEN A REAL PARTICLE CAN HAVE NEGATIVE ENERGY THERE IT IS THEREFORE POSSIBLE IF A BLACK HOLE IS PRESENT FOR THE VIRTUAL PARTICLE WITH NEGATIVE ENERGY TO FALL INTO THE BLACK HOLE AND BECOME A REAL PARTICLE OR ANTIPARTICLE IN THIS CASE IT NO LONGER HAS TO ANNIHILATE WITH ITS PARTNER ITS FORSAKEN PARTNER MAY FALL INTO THE BLACK HOLE AS WELL OR HAVING POSITIVE ENERGY IT MIGHT ALSO ESCAPE FROM THE VICINITY OF THE BLACK HOLE AS A REAL PARTICLE OR ANTIPARTICLE TO AN OBSERVER AT A DISTANCE IT WILL APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN EMITTED FROM THE BLACK HOLE THE SMALLER THE BLACK HOLE THE SHORTER THE DISTANCE THE PARTICLE WITH NEGATIVE ENERGY WILL HAVE TO GO BEFORE IT BECOMES A REAL PARTICLE AND THUS THE GREATER THE RATE OF EMISSION AND THE APPARENT TEMPERATURE OF THE BLACK HOLE THE POSITIVE ENERGY OF THE OUTGOING RADIATION WOULD BE BALANCED BY A FLOW OF NEGATIVE ENERGY PARTICLES INTO THE BLACK HOLE BY EINSTEINS EQUATION E MC WHERE E IS ENERGY M IS MASS AND C IS THE SPEED OF LIGHT ENERGY IS PROPORTIONAL TO MASS A FLOW OF NEGATIVE ENERGY INTO THE BLACK HOLE THEREFORE REDUCES ITS MASS AS THE BLACK HOLE LOSES MASS THE AREA OF ITS EVENT HORIZON GETS SMALLER BUT THIS DECREASE IN THE ENTROPY OF THE BLACK HOLE IS MORE THAN COMPENSATED FOR BY THE ENTROPY OF THE EMITTED RADIATION SO THE SECOND LAW IS NEVER VIOLATED MOREOVER THE LOWER THE MASS OF THE BLACK HOLE THE HIGHER ITS TEMPERATURE SO AS THE BLACK HOLE LOSES MASS ITS TEMPERATURE AND RATE OF EMISSION INCREASE SO IT LOSES MASS MORE QUICKLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MASS OF THE BLACK HOLE EVENTUALLY BECOMES EXTREMELY SMALL IS NOT QUITE CLEAR BUT THE MOST REASONABLE GUESS IS THAT IT WOULD DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY IN A TREMENDOUS FINAL BURST OF EMISSION EQUIVALENT TO THE EXPLOSION OF MILLIONS OF HBOMBS A BLACK HOLE WITH A MASS A FEW TIMES THAT OF THE SUN WOULD HAVE A TEMPERATURE OF ONLY ONE TEN MILLIONTH OF A DEGREE ABOVE ABSOLUTE ZERO THIS IS MUCH LESS THAN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE MICROWAVE RADIATION THAT FILLS THE UNIVERSE ABOUT  ABOVE ABSOLUTE ZERO SO SUCH BLACK HOLES WOULD EMIT EVEN LESS THAN THEY ABSORB IF THE UNIVERSE IS DESTINED TO GO ON EXPANDING FOREVER THE TEMPERATURE OF THE MICROWAVE RADIATION WILL EVENTUALLY DECREASE TO LESS THAN THAT OF SUCH A BLACK HOLE WHICH WILL THEN BEGIN TO LOSE MASS BUT EVEN THEN ITS TEMPERATURE WOULD BE SO LOW THAT IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT A MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION MILLION YEARS WITH SIXTYSIX ZEROS AFTER IT TO EVAPORATE COMPLETELY THIS IS MUCH LONGER THAN THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE WHICH IS ONLY ABOUT TEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND MILLION YEARS OR WITH TEN ZEROS AFTER IT ON THE OTHER HAND AS MENTIONED IN CHAPTER THERE MIGHT BE PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES WITH A VERY MUCH SMALLER MASS THAT WERE MADE BY THE COLLAPSE OF IRREGULARITIES IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF THE UNIVERSE SUCH BLACK HOLES WOULD HAVE A MUCH HIGHER TEMPERATURE AND WOULD BE EMITTING RADIATION AT A MUCH GREATER RATE A PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLE WITH AN INITIAL MASS OF A THOUSAND MILLION TONS WOULD HAVE A LIFETIME ROUGHLY EQUAL TO THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES WITH INITIAL MASSES LESS THAN THIS FIGURE WOULD ALREADY HAVE COMPLETELY EVAPORATED BUT THOSE WITH SLIGHTLY GREATER MASSES WOULD STILL BE EMITTING RADIATION IN THE FORM OF X RAYS AND GAMMA RAYS THESE X RAYS AND GAMMA RAYS ARE LIKE WAVES OF LIGHT BUT WITH A MUCH SHORTER WAVELENGTH SUCH HOLES HARDLY DESERVE THE EPITHET BLACK THEY REALLY ARE WHITE HOT AND ARE EMITTING ENERGY AT A RATE OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS ONE SUCH BLACK HOLE COULD RUN TEN LARGE POWER STATIONS IF ONLY WE COULD HARNESS ITS POWER THIS WOULD BE RATHER DIFFICULT HOWEVER THE BLACK HOLE WOULD HAVE THE MASS OF A MOUNTAIN COMPRESSED INTO LESS THAN A MILLION MILLIONTH OF AN INCH THE SIZE OF THE NUCLEUS OF AN ATOM IF YOU HAD ONE OF THESE BLACK HOLES ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH THERE WOULD BE NO WAY TO STOP IT FROM FALLING THROUGH THE FLOOR TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH IT WOULD OSCILLATE THROUGH THE EARTH AND BACK UNTIL EVENTUALLY IT SETTLED DOWN AT THE CENTER SO THE ONLY PLACE TO PUT SUCH A BLACK HOLE IN WHICH ONE MIGHT USE THE ENERGY THAT IT EMITTED WOULD BE IN ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH AND THE ONLY WAY THAT ONE COULD GET IT TO ORBIT THE EARTH WOULD BE TO ATTRACT IT THERE BY TOWING A LARGE MASS IN FRONT OF IT RATHER LIKE A CARROT IN FRONT OF A DONKEY THIS DOES NOT SOUND LIKE A VERY PRACTICAL PROPOSITION AT LEAST NOT IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE BUT EVEN IF WE CANNOT HARNESS THE EMISSION FROM THESE PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES WHAT ARE OUR CHANCES OF OBSERVING THEM WE COULD LOOK FOR THE GAMMA RAYS THAT THE PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES EMIT DURING MOST OF THEIR LIFETIME ALTHOUGH THE RADIATION FROM MOST WOULD BE VERY WEAK BECAUSE THEY ARE FAR AWAY THE TOTAL FROM ALL OF THEM MIGHT BE DETECTABLE WE DO OBSERVE SUCH A BACKGROUND OF GAMMA RAYS FIGURE SHOWS HOW THE OBSERVED INTENSITY DIFFERS AT DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES THE NUMBER OF WAVES PER SECOND HOWEVER THIS BACKGROUND COULD HAVE BEEN AND PROBABLY WAS GENERATED BY PROCESSES OTHER THAN PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES THE DOTTED LINE IN FIGURE SHOWS HOW THE INTENSITY SHOULD VARY WITH FREQUENCY FOR GAMMA RAYS GIVEN OFF BY PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES IF THERE WERE ON AVERAGE PER CUBIC LIGHT YEAR ONE CAN THEREFORE SAY THAT THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE GAMMA RAY BACKGROUND DO NOT PROVIDE ANY POSITIVE EVIDENCE FOR PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES BUT THEY DO TELL US THAT ON AVERAGE THERE CANNOT BE MORE THAN IN EVERY CUBIC LIGHT YEAR IN THE UNIVERSE THIS LIMIT MEANS THAT PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES COULD MAKE UP AT MOST ONE MILLIONTH OF THE MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE WITH PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES BEING SO SCARCE IT MIGHT SEEM UNLIKELY THAT THERE WOULD BE ONE NEAR ENOUGH FOR US TO OBSERVE AS AN INDIVIDUAL SOURCE OF GAMMA RAYS BUT SINCE GRAVITY WOULD DRAW PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES TOWARD ANY MATTER THEY SHOULD BE MUCH MORE COMMON IN AND AROUND GALAXIES SO ALTHOUGH THE GAMMA RAY BACKGROUND TELLS US THAT THERE CAN BE NO MORE THAN PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES PER CUBIC LIGHT YEAR ON AVERAGE IT TELLS US NOTHING ABOUT HOW COMMON THEY MIGHT BE IN OUR OWN GALAXY IF THEY WERE SAY A MILLION TIMES MORE COMMON THAN THIS THEN THE NEAREST BLACK HOLE TO US WOULD PROBABLY BE AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT A THOUSAND MILLION KILOMETERS OR ABOUT AS FAR AWAY AS PLUTO THE FARTHEST KNOWN PLANET AT THIS DISTANCE IT WOULD STILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DETECT THE STEADY EMISSION OF A BLACK HOLE EVEN IF IT WAS TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS IN ORDER TO OBSERVE A PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLE ONE WOULD HAVE TO DETECT SEVERAL GAMMA RAY QUANTA COMING FROM THE SAME DIRECTION WITHIN A REASONABLE SPACE OF TIME SUCH AS A WEEK OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT SIMPLY BE PART OF THE BACKGROUND BUT PLANCKS QUANTUM PRINCIPLE TELLS US THAT EACH GAMMA RAY QUANTUM HAS A VERY HIGH ENERGY BECAUSE GAMMA RAYS HAVE A VERY HIGH FREQUENCY SO IT WOULD NOT TAKE MANY QUANTA TO RADIATE EVEN TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS AND TO OBSERVE THESE FEW COMING FROM THE DISTANCE OF PLUTO WOULD REQUIRE A LARGER GAMMA RAY DETECTOR THAN ANY THAT HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED SO FAR MOREOVER THE DETECTOR WOULD HAVE TO BE IN SPACE BECAUSE GAMMA RAYS CANNOT PENETRATE THE ATMOSPHERE OF COURSE IF A BLACK HOLE AS CLOSE AS PLUTO WERE TO REACH THE END OF ITS LIFE AND BLOW UP IT WOULD BE EASY TO DETECT THE FINAL BURST OF EMISSION BUT IF THE BLACK HOLE HAS BEEN EMITTING FOR THE LAST TEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND MILLION YEARS THE CHANCE OF IT REACHING THE END OF ITS LIFE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS RATHER THAN SEVERAL MILLION YEARS IN THE PAST OR FUTURE IS REALLY RATHER SMALL SO IN ORDER TO HAVE A REASONABLE CHANCE OF SEEING AN EXPLOSION BEFORE YOUR RESEARCH GRANT RAN OUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO DETECT ANY EXPLOSIONS WITHIN A DISTANCE OF ABOUT ONE LIGHTYEAR IN FACT BURSTS OF GAMMA RAYS FROM SPACE HAVE BEEN DETECTED BY SATELLITES ORIGINALLY CONSTRUCTED TO LOOK FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE TEST BAN TREATY THESE SEEM TO OCCUR ABOUT SIXTEEN TIMES A MONTH AND TO BE ROUGHLY UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED IN DIRECTION ACROSS THE SKY THIS INDICATES THAT THEY COME FROM OUTSIDE THE SOLAR SYSTEM SINCE OTHERWISE WE WOULD EXPECT THEM TO BE CONCENTRATED TOWARD THE PLANE OF THE ORBITS OF THE PLANETS THE UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION ALSO INDICATES THAT THE SOURCES ARE EITHER FAIRLY NEAR TO US IN OUR GALAXY OR RIGHT OUTSIDE IT AT COSMOLOGICAL DISTANCES BECAUSE OTHERWISE AGAIN THEY WOULD BE CONCENTRATED TOWARD THE PLANE OF THE GALAXY IN THE LATTER CASE THE ENERGY REQUIRED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE BURSTS WOULD BE FAR TOO HIGH TO HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY TINY BLACK HOLES BUT IF THE SOURCES WERE CLOSE IN GALACTIC TERMS IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE THAT THEY WERE EXPLODING BLACK HOLES I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE THIS TO BE THE CASE BUT I HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE OTHER POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR THE GAMMA RAY BURSTS SUCH AS COLLIDING NEUTRON STARS NEW OBSERVATIONS IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS PARTICULARLY BY GRAVITATIONAL WAVE DETECTORS LIKE LIGO SHOULD ENABLE US TO DISCOVER THE ORIGIN OF THE GAMMA RAY BURSTS EVEN IF THE SEARCH FOR PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES PROVES NEGATIVE AS IT SEEMS IT MAY IT WILL STILL GIVE US IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF THE UNIVERSE IF THE EARLY UNIVERSE HAD BEEN CHAOTIC OR IRREGULAR OR IF THE PRESSURE OF MATTER HAD BEEN LOW ONE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IT TO PRODUCE MANY MORE PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES THAN THE LIMIT ALREADY SET BY OUR OBSERVATIONS OF THE GAMMA RAY BACKGROUND ONLY IF THE EARLY UNIVERSE WAS VERY SMOOTH AND UNIFORM WITH A HIGH PRESSURE CAN ONE EXPLAIN THE ABSENCE OF OBSERVABLE NUMBERS OF PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES THE IDEA OF RADIATION FROM BLACK HOLES WAS THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF A PREDICTION THAT DEPENDED IN AN ESSENTIAL WAY ON BOTH THE GREAT THEORIES OF THIS CENTURY GENERAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS IT AROUSED A LOT OF OPPOSITION INITIALLY BECAUSE IT UPSET THE EXISTING VIEWPOINT HOW CAN A BLACK HOLE EMIT ANYTHING WHEN I FIRST ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS OF MY CALCULATIONS AT A CONFERENCE AT THE RUTHERFORDAPPLETON LABORATORY NEAR OXFORD I WAS GREETED WITH GENERAL INCREDULITY AT THE END OF MY TALK THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SESSION JOHN G TAYLOR FROM KINGS COLLEGE LONDON CLAIMED IT WAS ALL NONSENSE HE EVEN WROTE A PAPER TO THAT EFFECT HOWEVER IN THE END MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING JOHN TAYLOR HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT BLACK HOLES MUST RADIATE LIKE HOT BODIES IF OUR OTHER IDEAS ABOUT GENERAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS ARE CORRECT THUS EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET MANAGED TO FIND A PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLE THERE IS FAIRLY GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT IF WE DID IT WOULD HAVE TO BE EMITTING A LOT OF GAMMA RAYS AND X RAYS THE EXISTENCE OF RADIATION FROM BLACK HOLES SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE IS NOT AS FINAL AND IRREVERSIBLE AS WE ONCE THOUGHT IF AN ASTRONAUT FALLS INTO A BLACK HOLE ITS MASS WILL INCREASE BUT EVENTUALLY THE ENERGY EQUIVALENT OF THAT EXTRA MASS WILL BE RETURNED TO THE UNIVERSE IN THE FORM OF RADIATION THUS IN A SENSE THE ASTRONAUT WILL BE RECYCLED IT WOULD BE A POOR SORT OF IMMORTALITY HOWEVER BECAUSE ANY PERSONAL CONCEPT OF TIME FOR THE ASTRONAUT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY COME TO AN END AS HE WAS TORN APART INSIDE THE BLACK HOLE EVEN THE TYPES OF PARTICLES THAT WERE EVENTUALLY EMITTED BY THE BLACK HOLE WOULD IN GENERAL BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE THAT MADE UP THE ASTRONAUT THE ONLY FEATURE OF THE ASTRONAUT THAT WOULD SURVIVE WOULD BE HIS MASS OR ENERGY THE APPROXIMATIONS I USED TO DERIVE THE EMISSION FROM BLACK HOLES SHOULD WORK WELL WHEN THE BLACK HOLE HAS A MASS GREATER THAN A FRACTION OF A GRAM HOWEVER THEY WILL BREAK DOWN AT THE END OF THE BLACK HOLES LIFE WHEN ITS MASS GETS VERY SMALL THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME SEEMS TO BE THAT THE BLACK HOLE WILL JUST DISAPPEAR AT LEAST FROM OUR REGION OF THE UNIVERSE TAKING WITH IT THE ASTRONAUT AND ANY SINGULARITY THERE MIGHT BE INSIDE IT IF INDEED THERE IS ONE THIS WAS THE FIRST INDICATION THAT QUANTUM MECHANICS MIGHT REMOVE THE SINGULARITIES THAT WERE PREDICTED BY GENERAL RELATIVITY HOWEVER THE METHODS THAT I AND OTHER PEOPLE WERE USING IN WERE NOT ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SUCH AS WHETHER SINGULARITIES WOULD OCCUR IN QUANTUM GRAVITY FROM ONWARD I THEREFORE STARTED TO DEVELOP A MORE POWERFUL APPROACH TO QUANTUM GRAVITY BASED ON RICHARD FEYNRNANS IDEA OF A SUM OVER HISTORIES THE ANSWERS THAT THIS APPROACH SUGGESTS FOR THE ORIGIN AND FATE OF THE UNIVERSE AND ITS CONTENTS SUCH AS ASTRONAUTS WILL BE DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT TWO CHAPTERS WE SHALL SEE THAT ALTHOUGH THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE PLACES LIMITATIONS ON THE ACCURACY OF ALL OUR PREDICTIONS IT MAY AT THE SAME TIME REMOVE THE FUNDAMENTAL UNPREDICTABILITY THAT OCCURS AT A SPACETIME SINGULARITY
